<h2>E-commerce Threats</h2>
E-security holds the key to e-commerce. The important security threats for e-commerce
are as follows:
<ul>
<li><b>Communication channel threats</b>
<br>The Internet is not at all secure. Message travel from source node to destination
node through different paths and through different intermediate computers. It is
very likely that some person can reach the message, alter the contents or
completely eliminate it from the network.</li>
<li><b>Secrecy threats</b>
<br>Secrecy and privacy are linked to each other. Secrecy is the prevention of
authorized information disclosure. Privacy is the protection of individual rights to
nondisclosure.
<br>A significant danger of conducting electronic commerce is theft of
sensitive or personal information, including credit card numbers, names, address
and personal preferences.</li>
<li><b>Integrity threats</b>
<br>An integrity threats occurs when an unauthorized person alters a message stream
of information.</li>
<li><b>Server threats</b>
<br>The server is highly vulnerable and forms the threat link in the Client -Internet-
Server group serving the electronic commerce path between the commerce server
and a user.</li>
<li><b>Necessity threats</b>
<br>The purpose of these treats is to disrupt normal computer processing or to deny
processing entirely. The computer experiencing a necessity threat slows down
processing to a very low speed.</li>
<li><b>Web server threats</b>
<br>A web server threat is caused when we set up a web server to run in high
privilege status. Ordinarily a web server provides ordinary services and regular
tasks which can be carried out with a very low pri vilege level. If a server is
running at a high privilege level, a hacker can exploit the web server and
subsequently executing instructions in privilege modes.</li>
</ul>
