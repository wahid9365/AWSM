    <title>JPEG (Joint Photographic Expert Group)-Steps of the JPEG compression process-JPEG Modes</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h3>JPEG (Joint Photographic Expert Group)</h3>
    <p>The coding known as JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is a joint project of
        ISO/IECJTC1/SC2/WG10 and Commission Q.16 of CCITT SGVIII. Hence, the ―J‖ (from
        ―Joint‖) in JPEG—ISO together with CCITT. In 1992, JPEG became an ISO International
        Standard (IS).</p>
        <p>JPEG applies to color and gray-scaled still images. A fast coding and decoding of still
            Images is also used for video sequences known as Motion JPEG. Today, parts of JPEG are
            already available as software-only packages or together with specific hardware support.</p>
            <h3>Steps of the JPEG compression process</h3>
            <p>The fundamental steps of JPEG compression is shown in below Figure. JPEG defines several
                image compression modes by selecting different combinations of these steps.</p>

                 <h3>JPEG Modes</h3>
                 <ul>
                    <p>JPEG defines four modes, which themselves include additional variations:</p>
                    <li>The lossy, sequential DCT-based mode (baseline process, base mode) must be
                        supported by every JPEG decoder.</li>
                    <li>The expanded lossy, DCT-based mode provides a set of further enhancements to the
                        base mode.</li>
                    <li>The lossless mode has a low compression ratio and allows a perfect reconstruction of
                        the original image.</li>
                    <li>The hierarchical mode accommodates images of different resolutions by using
                        algorithms defined for the other three modes.</li>
                  
                </ul>
