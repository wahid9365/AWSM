    <h3>Graphics Format</h3>
    <p>Graphics image formats are specified through graphics primitives and their attributes, To
        the category of graphics primitives belong lines, rectangles, circles and ellipses, text strings
        specifying two dimensional objects (2D) in a graphics image package or , e.g, polyhedron,
        specifying three-dimensional objects (3D).</p>
        <p>A graphics determines which primitives are supported. Attributes such as line style, line
            width, and color affect the outcome of the graphical image. Graphics primitives and their
            attributes represent a higher level of an image representation, i.e., the graphical images are not
            represented by a pixel matrix.</p>
            <p>This higher level of representation needs to be converted at some point of the image
                processing into the lower level of the image representation; for example, when an image is to be
                displayed.</p>
                <p>The graphics packages like SRGP (Simple Raster Graphics Package) provide such a
                    conversion, i.e., they take the graphics primitives and attributes and generate either a bitmap or
                    pixmap.</p>
                    <p>Packages such as PHIGS (Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics Sys-tem) and
                        GKS (Graphical Kernel System) take graphical images specified through primitives and
                        attributes, generate a graphical image in the form of Pixmap and after image presentation,
                        continue to work based on the object primitive/attribute representation. In this case, the graphical
                        image format is presented after the generation phase as a structure, which is a logical grouping of
                        attributes and other information.</p>
