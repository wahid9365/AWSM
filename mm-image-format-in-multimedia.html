    <h3>Image Format</h3>
    <Ul><li><b>Captured Image Format:</b> The image format is specified by two main parameters:
        spatial resolution, which is specified as 𝑝𝑖𝑥𝑒𝑙𝑠 × 𝑝𝑖𝑥𝑒𝑙𝑠 and color encoding, which is
        specified by bits per pixel. Both parameter values depend on hardware and software for
        input output of images. As an example we will present image formats supported on
        SPARC and IRIS computers. For image capturing on a SPARC station, the VideoPixTM
        card and its software can be used. The spatial resolution is 320 x 240 pixels. The color
        can be encoded with 1-bit (a binary image format), 8-bit (color or grayscale) or 24-bit
        (color- RGB).</li><br>
    <li><b>Stored Image Format:</b> When we store an image, we are storing a two-dimensional array
        of values, in which each value represents the data associated with a pixel in the image.
        For a bitmap, this value is a binary digit. For a color image, the value may be a collection
        of:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Three numbers representing the intensities of the red, green and blue components
                of the color at that pixel.</li>
            <li>Three numbers that are indices to tables of red, green and blue intensities.</li>
            <li>A single number that is an index to a table of color triples.</li>
            <li>An index to any number of other data structures that can represent a color,
                including X YZ color system.</li>
            <li>Four or five spectral samples for each color.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some current image file formats for storing images include GIP (Graphical In-terchange
            Format), X11 Bitmap, Sun Rasterfile, PostScript, IRIS, JPEG, TIFF (Tagged Image File Format)
            and others.</p>
