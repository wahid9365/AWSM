    <h3>MPEG</h3>
    <p>MPEG is developed and defined by ISO/IEC JTC1/SC 29/WG 11 to cover motion video
        as well as audio coding. In light of the state of the art in CD technology, the goal was a
        compressed stream data rate of about 1.2Mbit/s. MPEG specifies a maximum data rate of
        1,856,000 bit/s. The data rate for each audio channel can be chosen between 32 and 448 Kbit/s in
        increments of 16Kbit/s. This data rate enables video and audio compression of acceptable
        quality. Since 1993, MPEG has been an International Standard (IS).</p>
        <p>MPEG is suitable for asymmetric compression as well as symmetric compression.
            Asymmetric coding requires considerably more effort for encoding than for decoding.
            Compression is carried out once, whereas decompression is performed many times. A typical
            application area is retrieval systems. Symmetric compression is characterized by a comparable
            effort for the compression and decompression processing. This is a requirement for interactive
            dialogue applications, as is a bounded processing delay for the processing.</p>
            <h3>MPEG Audio Encoding</h3>
    <p>Audio Coding MPEG audio coding is compatible with the coding of audio data used for
        Compact Disc Digital Audio (CD-DA) and Digital Audio Tape (DAT). The most important
        criterion is the choice of sample rate of 44.1kHz or 48kHz (additionally 32kHz) at 16bits per
        sample value. Each audio signal is compressed to either 64, 96, 128, or 192Kbit/s.</p>
        <p>Three quality layers, as shown in below figure, are defined with different encoding and
            decoding complexity. An implementation of a higher layer must be able to decode the MPEG
            audio signals of lower layers. A transformation into the frequency domain is applied for audio.
            The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is a suitable technique.The relevant portion of the spectrum is
            divided into 32 non-overlapping subbands. The audio signal is thus split into 32 subbands.
            Different components of the spectrum can then be quantized differently. In parallel with the
            actual FFT, the noise level in each subband is determined using a psychoacoustic model. At a
            higher noise level, a coarser quantization is performed. A lower noise level results in finer
            quantization.</p>
            <p>In the first and second layers, the appropriately quantized spectral components are simply
                PCM-encoded. The third layer additionally performs Huffman coding.</p>
                <p>Audio coding can be performed on stereo sound, a single channel, or two independent
                    channels. MPEG provides for two types of stereo sound. In the first case, two channels are
                    processed completely independently. In the joint stereo mode, MPEG achieves a higher
                    compression ratio by exploiting redundancies between the two channels.</p>
