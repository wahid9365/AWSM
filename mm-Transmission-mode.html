    <h3>Asynchronous Transmission mode</h3>
    <p>The asynchronous transmission mode provides for communication without
        time restriction. Packets reach the receiver as fast as possible. For example,
        protocols of the world wide internet for electronic mail.<br>
        All information of discrete media can be transmitted as an asynchrounous
        data stream.</p>
        
<h3>Synchronous Transmission mode</h3
    <p>The synchronous transmission mode defines a maximum end-to-end delay
        for each packet of a data stream. This upper bound will never be violated. A
        packet can reach the receiver at any arbitrary earlier time.<br>
        An audio connection can be established over a LAN which supports
        synchronous transmission mode.</p>
        <h3>Isochronous Transmission Mode</h3>
        <p>Isochronous transmission mode defines, besides a maximum end-to-end
            delay fro each packet of a data stream, a minimum end-to-end delay. That means
            the delay jitter of individual packets is bounded.</p>
