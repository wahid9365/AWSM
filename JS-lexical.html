<h2>Lexical Structure</h2>
A programming language’s lexical structure specifies set of some basic rules about how a code should be written in it. Rules like what variable names looks like, the delimiter characters for comments, and how one program statement is separated from the next. It is the lowest-level syntax of a language.
<h2>Character Set</h2>
Unicode character set is used in JavaScript codes.Almost every writing system is supported by Unicode.
<h2>Case Sensitive</h2>
JS is a case-sensitive language.'While', 'while', 'WHILE' are all three different words in JavaScript with different meanings and functionality. It means that language keywords, variables, function names, and other identifiers must always be typed with a consistent capitalization of letters.
<h2>Whitespaces and Line Breaks</h2>
JavaScript is ignorant to spaces that appear between tokens in codes. Line breaks are also not considered by JS. This lets you freely use any number of spaces and newlines. It can help in indentation and formatting of codes which makes them readable and easy to understand.
<h2>Literals</h2>
A 'literal' is a data value that appears directly in a program. The following are all literals:
<br>
<pre>
12 		// The number twelve
1.2 		// The number one point two
"hello world" 	// A string of text
'Hi' 		// Another string
true		// A Boolean value
false		// The other Boolean value
null		// Absence of an object
</pre>
<h2>Comments</h2>
Two types of comments are supported by JS.
<ol type="i"><li>Single Line. E.g., // this is a single line comment in JS</li>
<li>Multiple Line. E.g.,
<br>/* this is a
<br>multiple line
<br>comment */</li></ol>
</body>
