<h2>E-tailing:</h2>
Electronic retailing (E-tailing) is the sale of goods and services through the
internet. E-tailing can include business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-
consumer (B2C) sales of products and services.
<h3>Popularity:</h3>
E-tailing in India is gaining popularity with the increased proliferation of
smartphones and the internet. According to Redseer Strategy consultants,
Online retailer's highly relevant and affordable supply along with standardised
experience on the platforms, make eCommerce attractive to shoppers.
<h3>Benefits:</h3>
<ul>
<li>E-tailing is able to reach a broader range of consumers.</li>
<li>Consumers are able to purchase unique products not offered in their
country.</li>
<li>Most of the world enjoys easy access to the internet and is educated on
how to use it.</li>
<li>Overhead is significantly reduced (i.e.. rent, sales staff).</li>
<li>E-tailing is a rapidly growing market that will eventually out-grow
regular retailing.</li>
<li>A widened market range and market differentiation.</li>
<li>Customer intelligence tools to target and retain new customers.</li>
<li>E-tailing increases consumer convenience (i.e., reduces travel time if they
were to shop at a regular retailer).</li>
<li>Advertising becomes more meaningful and impactful to customers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Problems:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Some target consumers lack access to the internet</li>
<li>Complexity in conducting business completely online</li>
<li>Hackers will attempt to gain consumer information</li>
<li>High return rate because of lack of physical examination sizing of the
good</li>
<li>Decrease in experience compared to brick-and-mortar shopping</li>
<li>High costs associated with maintaining a website</li>
<li>Need for warehousing</li>
</ul>
<h3>Features:</h3>
E-tailing also allows companies to close unprofitable stores and maintain the
profitable ones. Automated sales and checkout cut down on the need for staff
and sales personnel. Also, websites cost less than physical stores to open, staff,
and maintain.
