<h2>Computer Classification</h2>
Computers can be generally classified by size and power as follows, though there is
Considerable overlap:
<ul>
<li><b>Personal computer:</b><br>A small, single-user computer based on a microprocessor. In
addition to the microprocessor, a personal computer has a keyboard for entering
data, a monitor for displaying information, and a storage device for saving data.</li>
<li><b>Workstation :</b><br> A powerful, single-user computer. A workstation is like a personal
computer, but it has a more powerful microprocessor and a higher-quality
monitor.</li>
<li><b>Minicomputer :</b><br> A multi-user computer capable of supporting from 10 to hundreds of
users simultaneously.</li>
<li><b>Mainframe :</b><br> A powerful multi-user computer capable of supporting many hundreds
or thousands of users simultaneously.</li>
<li><b>Supercomputer :</b><br> An extremely fast computer that can perform hundreds of millions
of instructions per second.</li>
</ul>
