    <title>Image Synthesis in Multimedia</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h3>Image Synthesis</h3>
    <p>Image synthesis is an integral part of all computer user interfaces and is indispensable for
        visualizing 2D, 3D and higher-dimensional objects. Areas as diverse as education, science,
        engineering, medicine, advertising and entertainment all rely on graphics. Applications of image
        synthesis are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>User Interfaces</b> Applications running on personal computers and workstations have user
            interfaces that rely on desktop window systems to manage multiple simultaneous
            activities, and on point-and-click facilities to allow users to select menu items, icons and
            objects on the screen.</li>
        <li><b>Office Automation and Electronic Publishing:</b> The use of graphics for the creation and
            dissemination of information has increased enormously since the advent of desktop
            publishing on personal computers.</li>
        <li><b>Simulations and Animation for Scientific Visualization and Entertainment:</b>
            Computer- produced animated movies and displays of time-varying behavior of real and
            simulated objects are becoming increasingly popular for scientific and engineering
            visualization.</li>
    </ul>
