    <title>TRANSMISSION MODES</title>

    <h3>TRANSMISSION MODES</h3>
    The transmission of binary data across a link can be accomplished in either parallel or
serial mode.
<ul>
    <li>In parallel mode, multiple bits are sent with each clock tick.</li>
    <li>In serial mode, 1 bit is sent with each clock tick.</li>
    </ul>
    Different data transmission modes are shown in below figure:

    <h3>Parallel Transmission</h3>
    In parallel transmission, binary data consisting of 0s and 1s are organized into a group of
    n bits and send the group of n-bits at a time.
    <p>The parallel transmission use n wires to send n bits at one time. That way each bit has its
        own wire, and all n bits of one group can be transmitted with each clock tick from one device to
        another. Below Figure shows how parallel transmission works for n =8.</p>

    <h3>Serial Transmission</h3>
    In serial transmission one bit follows another, so we need only one communication
channel rather than n to transmit data between two communicating devices as shown in below
figure:

<p>Serial transmission occurs in one of three ways: asynchronous, synchronous, and isochronous.</p>

    <h3>Asynchronous Transmission</h3>
    In asynchronous transmission, we send 1 start bit (0) at the beginning and 1 or more stop
bits (1s) at the end of each byte. There may be a gap between each byte. Below figure is a
schematic illustration of asynchronous transmission. In this example, the start bits are 0s, the
stop bits are 1s, and the gap is represented by an idle line.

    <h3>Synchronous Transmission</h3>
    In synchronous transmission, the bit stream is combined into longer "frames," which may
    contain multiple bytes. Each byte, however, is introduced onto the transmission link without a
    gap between it and the next one. It is left to the receiver to separate the bit stream into bytes for
    decoding purposes. Below Figure gives a schematic illustration of synchronous transmission.

    <h3>Isochronous Transmission</h3>
    An isochronous data transfer system combines the features of an asynchronous and
synchronous data transfer system. An isochronous data transfer system sends blocks of data
asynchronously, in other words the data stream can be transferred at random intervals. Each
transmission begins with a start packet. Once the start packet is transmitted, the data must be
delivered with a guaranteed bandwidth. Isochronous data transfer is commonly used for where
data must be delivered within certain time constraints, like streaming video.
