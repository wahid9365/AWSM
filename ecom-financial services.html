<h2>E-Commerce Financial Services</h2>
Predictions are, that by 2040, nearly all retail purchases (95%) will be made
online. If these predictions come true, the global retail e-commerce level will
reach $24 trillion. A big part of the benefits of e-commerce for retailers will
come from the online sales and purchases of e-commerce financial services. The
fintech applications for e-commerce will allow retailers to capture a big share of
fintech products sales.

deposits of paychecks, online bill paying, and many other convenient banking
services.
