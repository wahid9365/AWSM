<h2>Security breaches</h2>
A security breach occurs when an intruder gains unauthorized access to an organization’s
protected systems and data. Cybercriminals or malicious applications bypass security
mechanisms to reach restricted areas. A security breach is an early-stage violation that can lead
to things like system damage and data loss.
<h3>Types of security breaches</h3>
Attackers can initiate different types of security breaches. The main three types are as follows:
<ul>
<li><b>Viruses, spyware, and other malware</b><br>
Cybercriminals often use malicious software to break in to protected networks. Viruses,
spyware, and other types of malware often arrive by email or from downloads from the
internet.</li>
<li><b>Impersonation of an organization</b><br>
Cybercriminals sometimes can create a gap in security by sending a bogus, but
convincing email to an employee of an organization. The email is made to appear like it’s
from an executive with an urgent request for, say, employment records, log-in
information, or other sensitive data. Eager to fill the request, the employee may email
back the information — putting it in the hands of cybercriminals.
This tactic is known as phishing — or spearfishing, if the email is highly targeted
to a specific person.</li>
<li><b>Denial of service (DDoS) attacks</b><br>
A denial-of-service attack is capable of crashing websites. Hackers can make a website
— or a computer — unavailable by flooding it with traffic. DDoS attacks are considered
security breaches because they can overwhelm an organization’s security devices and its
ability to do business. DDoS attacks often target government or financial websites. The
motive can be activism, revenge, or extortion. During an attack, anyone who has
legitimate business with an organization — like you — will be unable to access the
website.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to help protect our self from a security breach</h3>
Here are some examples.
<ul>
<li><b>Create strong, secure passwords:</b> That means using uppercase and lowercase letters, as
well as non-sequential numbers and special characters.</li>
<li><b>Use different passwords on different accounts:</b> If one account is compromised,
cybercriminals won’t be able to easily access our other accounts.</li>
<li><b>Use secure websites:</b> Look for “https” in the web address. It indicates a
secure, encrypted connection.</li>
<li><b>Install updates:</b> Always update computers and mobile devices with the latest versions of
operating systems and applications. Updates sometimes contain patches for security
vulnerabilities.</li>
<li><b>Stay informed:</b> If you do business with a company that’s had a data breach, find out
what information was taken and how it could affect you. Companies sometimes set up a
website to keep consumers informed.</li>
<li><b>Be watchful:</b> Monitor online and monthly financial account statements to make sure the
transactions are legitimate.</li>
<li><b>Sign up for credit reports:</b> Regularly check your credit reports to make sure an imposter
hasn’t opened credit cards, loans, or other accounts in your name.</li>
<li><b>Consider credit services:</b> Credit freezes, credit monitoring, and identity theft
protection services can help you keep track of your information.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hacking</h2>
Hacking is an attempt to exploit a computer system or a private network inside a
computer. Simply put, it is the unauthorised access to or control over computer network security
systems for some illicit purpose.
<h2>Sniffing</h2>
Sniffing is a process of monitoring and capturing all data packets passing through given
network. Sniffers are used by network/system administrator to monitor and troubleshoot network
traffic. Attackers use sniffers to capture data packets containing sensitive information such as
password, account information etc. Sniffers can be hardware or software installed in the system.
By placing a packet sniffer on a network in promiscuous mode, a malicious intruder can capture
and analyze all of the network traffic.
<p>There are two types viz. Active sniffing and passive sniffing.
<ul>
<li><b>Active sniffing:</b> Sniffing in the switch is active sniffing. A switch is a point to point network
device.</li>
<li><b>Passive Sniffing:</b> This is the process of sniffing through the hub. Any traffic that is passing
through the non-switched or unbridged network segment can be seen by all machines on that
segment. Sniffers operate at the data link layer of the network. Any data sent across the LAN is
actually sent to each and every machine connected to the LAN. This is called passive since
sniffers placed by the attackers passively wait for the data to be sent and capture them.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Cyber Vandalism</h2>
Cyber-Vandalism accounts to the act of damaging someone’s data from the computer that
in a way disrupts the victim’s business or image due to editing the data into something invasive,
embarrassing or absurd. It is digital equivalent of conventional vandalism wherein legitimate
content of a website will be made unavailable or replaced. Cyber-vandalism is different from
computer viruses that attach into the programs.
<p>Cyber-Vandalism leads to other risks also that could be dangerous for our computer
system, our identity, our precious personal data and your finances.</p>
