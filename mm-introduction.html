    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Multimedia has become an inevitable part of any presentation. It has found a
        variety of applications right from entertainment to education. The evolution of internet
        has also increased the demand for multimedia content.</p><br>
       <p> <b>Multimedia : </b> Multimedia is the field concerned with the computer-controlled integration of text,
        graphics, drawings, still and moving images (Video), animation, audio, and any other
        media where every type of information can be represented, stored, transmitted and
        processed digitally.</p>
        <h5>Multimedia composed of two word:</h5>
        <p><b>Multi-</b> means many; multiple</p>
        <p><b>Medium:</b> an intervening substances through which something is
            transmitted or carried on; A means of mass communication such as newspaper, magazine
            or television.</p>
            <p>From the userâ€™s perspective, multimedia means that representation of computer
                information through audio and/or video, in addition to text, image, graphics and
                animation.</p>
                <p>A multimedia system is characterized by computer controlled, integrated
                    production, manipulation, presentation, storage and communication of independent
                    information which is encoded at least through a continuous ( time-dependent) and
                    discrete ( time-independent) medium.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The integration of the different media into the computer provides additional
                            possibilities for the use of computational power currently available. For example,
                            interactive presentation of huge amount of information.</li>
                        <li>In multimedia system, data can be transmitted through computer and
                            telecommunication networks, which implies in application in the areas of information
                            distribution and cooperative work.</li>
                        <li>One of the first and best known institutes working on different aspects of multimedia
                            is the MIT Media Lab in Boston. Research in going on there on a variety of future
                            applications such as personal newspaper and holography.</li>
                        
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Medium</h2>
                    <p>Medium can be describes as a means for distribution and presentation of
                        information. Examples of a medium are text, graphics, speech and music.</p>
