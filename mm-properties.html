    <h2>Main properties of Multimedia system</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h3> Combination of media:</h3>
            <p>Every arbitrary combination of media cannot be justified as multimedia. A text
                processing program with incorporated image is not a multimedia application.
                Multimedia system incorporates both continuous and discrete media.</p></li>
        <li><h3>Independence:</h3>
        <p>An important aspect of different media is their level of independence from each
            other. A computer controlled video recorder stores audio and video information,
            but there is a inherently tight connection between two types of media. Both media
            are coupled together through the common storage medium.</p></li>
        <li><h3>Computer supported Integration</h3>
        <p>The media independence pre-requisite provides the possibility of combining media
            in arbitrary forms. Computers are the ideal tool for this purpose. Computer-
            controlled data of independent media can be integrated to accomplish certain
            functions.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Communication system</h3>
            <p>Communication- capable multimedia system must be approached. The most of the
                todayâ€™s computer are interconnected and the distributed environment enable
                particularly interesting multimedia application through the communication capable
                multimedia system.</p></li>
