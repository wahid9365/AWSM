    <title>DISPLAY and TRANSMISSION OF ANIMATION</title>

    <h3>DISPLAY OF ANIMATION</h3>
    <p>To display animations with raster systems, animated objects (which may consist of
        graphical primitives such as lines, polygons, and so on) must be scan-converted into their pixmap
        in the frame buffer. To show a rotating object, we can scan-convert into the pixmap successive
        views from slightly different locations, one after another. This scan-conversion must be done at
        least 10 (preferably 15 to 20) times per second to give a reasonably smooth effect: hence a new
        image must be created in no more than 100 milliseconds.</p>
       <h3 >TRANSMISSION OF ANIMATION </h3> 
       <p>Animated objects may be represented symbolically using graphical objects or scan-converted
        pixmap images. Hence, the transmission of animation over computer networks may be
        performed using one of two approaches:</p>
     <ul>
        <LI>The symbolic representation (e.g., circle) of animation objects (e.g., ball) is transmitted
            together with the operation commands (e.g., roll the ball) performed on the object. In this
            case, the transmission time is short because the symbolic representation of an animated
            object is smaller in byte size than its pixmap representation, but the display time at the
            receiver takes longer because the scan-converting operation has to be performed at the
            receiver side. In this approach, the transmission rate (bits/second or bytes/second) of
            animated objects depends</LI>
            <ol id="roman">
                <li>On the size of the symbolic representation structure, where the animated object is
                    encoded,</li>
                    <li>On the size of the structure, where the operation command is encoded,</li>
                    <li>On the number of animated objects and operation commands sent per second.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>The pixmap representation of the animated objects is transmitted and displayed on the
                receiver side. In this case, the transmission time is longer in Comparison to the previous
                approach because of the size of the pixmap representation, but the display time is shorter
                because the scan-conversion of the animated objects is avoided at the receiver side. It is
                performed at the sender side where animation objects and operation commands are
                generated.
               <p>In this approach, the transmission rate of the animation is equal to the size of the pixmap
                representation of an animated object (graphical image) multiplied by the number of
                graphical images per second.</p></li>
