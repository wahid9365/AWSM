    <h3>ANIMATION LANGUAGES</h3>
    <p>There are many different languages for describing animation. The animation languages are
        divided into following three categories:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Linear-list Notations</li>
            <li>General-purpose Languages</li>
            <li>Graphical Languages</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Linear-list Notations</h4>
        <p>In linear-list notations for animation each event in the animation is described by a starting
            and ending frame number and an action that is to take place (event). The actions typically take
            different parameters. For example, a statement</p>
            <b>42, 53, B, ROTATE, "PALM" ,1, 30</b>
            <p>means "between frames 42 and 53, rotate the object called PALM about axis 1 by 30 degrees,
                determining the amount of rotation at each frame from table B”.</p>
                <h4>General-purpose Languages</h4>   
                <p>Another way to describe animation is to embed an animation capability within a general-
                    purpose programming language. The values of variables in the language can be used as
                    parameters to the routines, which perform the animation.</p> 
                    <h4>Graphical Languages</h4>
                    <p>Graphical animation languages describe animation in a more visual way. These languages
                        are used for expressing, editing and comprehending the simultaneous changes taking place in an
                        animation. The principal notion in such languages is substitution of a visual paradigm for a
                        textual one. Rather than explicitly writing out descriptions of actions, the animator provides a
                        picture of the action. Examples of such systems and languages are GENESYSTM , DIAL and S-
                        Dynamics System.</p>
