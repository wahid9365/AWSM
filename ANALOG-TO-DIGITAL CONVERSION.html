        <h3>Pulse Code Modulation (PCM)</h3>
        The most common technique to change an analog signal to digital data (digitization) is
        called pulse code modulation (PCM). A PCM encoder has three processes, as shown in below
        Figure:

        <ul>
            <li>The analog signal is sampled</li>
            <li>The sampled signal is quantized.</li>
            <li>The quantized values are encoded as streams of bits.</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Sampling</h3>
        The first step in PCM is sampling. The analog signal is sampled every Ts s, where Ts is
the sample interval or period. The inverse of the sampling interval is called the sampling rate or
sampling frequency and denoted by fs, where fs = 1/Ts. There are three sampling methods-ideal,
natural, and flat-top-as shown in Figure below.

The sampling process is sometimes referred to as pulse amplitude modulation (PAM).

    <h3>Quantization</h3>
    The second step in PCM is quantization. The following are the steps in quantization:
    <ol>
        <li>We assume that the original analog signal has instantaneous amplitudes between Vmin
            and Vmax.</li>
        <li>We divide the range into L zones, each of height ∆ (delta).</li>
        <li>We assign quantized values of 0 to L - I to the midpoint of each zone.</li>
        <li>We approximate the value of the sample amplitude to the quantized values.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>As a simple example, assume that we have a sampled signal and the sample amplitudes are
        between -20 and +20 V. We decide to have eight levels (L = 8). This means that ∆= 5 𝑉. Below
        Figure shows this example.</p>

        <h3>Encoding</h3>
        The last step in PCM is encoding. After each sample is quantized and the number of bits
        per sample is decided, each sample can be changed to an nb-bit code word. A quantization code
        of 2 is encoded as 010; 5 is encoded as 101; and so on.
        <p>The number of bits for each sample is determined from the number of quantization levels.
            If the number of quantization levels is L, the number of bits is nb =log2L.</p>
            In our example L is 8 and nb is therefore 3. The bit rate can be found from the formula:
            <pre>𝐵𝑖𝑡 𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒 = 𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 × 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑏𝑖𝑡𝑠 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒 = F𝑠 × N𝑏</pre>
