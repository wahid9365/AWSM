        <h3>IPv4 Address</h3>
        An IPv4 address is a 32-bit address that uniquely and universally defines the connection
of a device (for example, a computer or a router) to the Internet.
  <p>IPv4 addresses are unique. They are unique in the sense that each address defines one,
    and only one, connection to the Internet. Two devices on the Internet can never have the same
    address at the same time.</p>
    <p>The IPv4 addresses are universal in the sense that the addressing system must be accepted
        by any host that wants to be connected to the Internet.</p>

    <h3>Address space of IPv4</h3>
    A protocol such as IPv4 that defines addresses has an address space. An address space is
the total number of addresses used by the protocol. If a protocol uses N bits to define an address,
the address space is 2N because each bit can have two different values (0 or 1) and N bits can
have 2N values.
<p>IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses, which means that the address space is 232 or 4,294,967,296
    (more than 4 billion). This means that, theoretically, if there were no restrictions, more than 4
    billion devices could be connected to the Internet.</p>

    <h3>Notations of IPv4 address</h3>
    There are two prevalent notations to show an IPv4 address: binary notation and dotted
decimal notation.
<ul>
    <li>Binary Notation: In binary notation, the IPv4 address is displayed as 32 bits. The
        following is an example of an IPv4 address in binary notation:</li>
        <pre>01110101 10010101 00011101 00000010</pre>
    <li>Dotted-Decimal Notation: To make the IPv4 address more compact and easier to
        read, Internet addresses are usually written in decimal form with a decimal point (dot)
        separating the bytes. The following is the dotted-decimal notation of the above
        address</li>
    
</ul>
