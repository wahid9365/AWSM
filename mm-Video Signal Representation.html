    <h3>Video Signal Representation</h3>
    <p>In conventional black-and-white TV sets, the video signal is displayed using a CRT (Cathode
        Ray Tube). An electron beam carries corresponding pattern information, such as intensity in a
        viewed scene.</p>
        <p><b>Video signal representation includes three aspects the:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Visual representation</li>
            <li>Transmission</li>
            <li>Digitalization.</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <Li><b>Visual representation : </b>A central objective is to offer the viewer a sense of presence in the scene and of
                participation in the events portrayed. „To meet this objective, the televised image should convey
                spatial and temporal content of the scene.</Li>
            <Li><b>Transmission</b>Video signals are transmitted to receivers through a single television channel. Thé NTSC channel
                is shown in below Figure.
               <p> To encode color, a video signal is a composite of three signals. For transmission
                purposes, a video signal consists of one luminance and two chrominance signals. In NTSC and
                PAL systems, the composite transmission of luminance and chrominance signals in a single
                channel is achieved by specifying the chrominance subcarrier to be an odd multiple of one-half
                of the line-scanning frequency.</p>
               <p> In practice, degradation in the image, known as cross-color and cross-luminance occurs.
                These effects have pushed manufacturers of NTSC receivers to limit the luminance bandwidth to
                less than 3 MHz below the 3.58 MHz subcarrier frequency and far short of the 4.2 MHz
                maximum of the broadcast signal.</p></Li>
            <Li><b>Digitalization:</b>Before a picture or motion video can be processed by a computer or transmitted over a computer
                network, it needs to be converted from analog to digital representation.
            <p>Digitalization consists of sampling the gray (color) level in the picture at M x N array of
                points. Since the gray level at these points may take any value in a continuous range, for digital
                processing, the gray level must be quantized. By this we mean that we divide the range of gray
                levels into K intervals and require the gray level at any point to take on only one of these values.</p>
            <p>The result of sampling and quantizing is a digital (picture), at which point we have
                obtained a rectangular array of integer values representing pixels.</p></Li>
