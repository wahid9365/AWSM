        <h3>Line Coding</h3>
        Line coding is the process of converting digital data to digital signals. At the sender,
    digital data are encoded into a digital signal; at the receiver, the digital data are recreated by
    decoding the digital signal.

        <h3>Line Coding Schemes</h3>
        Different line coding schemes are shown in below figure:

            <h3>Unipolar Scheme</h3>
            In a unipolar scheme, all the signal levels are on one side of the time axis, either above or
below.
<p>Traditionally, a unipolar scheme was designed as a non-return-to-zero (NRZ) scheme in
    which the positive voltage defines bit 1 and the zero voltage defines bit 0. It is called NRZ
    because the signal does not return to zero at the middle of the bit. Below Figure show a unipolar
    NRZ scheme.</p>

        <h3>Polar Schemes</h3>
        In polar schemes, the voltages are on the both sides of the time axis. For example, the voltage
        level for 0 can be positive and the voltage level for 1 can be negative.
        In polar NRZ encoding, we use two levels of voltage amplitude. We can have two versions of
        polar NRZ: NRZ-L and NRZ-I, as shown in below figure.
        <p>In the first variation, NRZ-L (NRZ-Level), the level of the voltage determines the value of
            the bit. In the second variation, NRZ-I (NRZ-Invert), the change or lack of change in the level of
            the voltage determines the value of the bit. If there is no change, the bit is 0; if there is a change,
            the bit is 1.</p>

        <h3>Bipolar Schemes</h3>
        In bipolar encoding, there are three voltage levels: positive, negative, and zero. The
voltage level for one data element is at zero, while the voltage level for the other element
alternates between positive and negative.
<p>Two variations of bipolar encoding schemes are: AMI and Pseudoternary.</p>
 <p>A common bipolar encoding scheme is called bipolar alternate mark inversion (AMI)
    means alternate 1 inversion. A neutral zero voltage represents binary 0. Binary 1s are represented
    by alternating positive and negative voltages.</p>
    <p>A variation of AMI encoding is called pseudoternary in which the 1 bit is encoded as a
        zero voltage and the 0 bit is encoded as alternating positive and negative voltages.</p>

        <h3>Multilevel Schemes</h3>
        The desire to increase the data speed or decrease the required bandwidth has resulted in
        the creation of many schemes. The goal is to increase the number of bits per baud by encoding a
        pattern of m data elements into a pattern of n signal elements.    
   <p>The code designers have classified these types of coding as mBnL, where m is the length
    of the binary pattern, B means binary data, n is the length of the signal pattern, and L is the
    number of levels in the signaling. A letter is often used in place of L: B (binary) for L =2, T
    (ternary) for L=3, and Q (quaternary) for L =4.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Note that the first two letters define the data pattern, and the second two define the signal
            pattern.</li>
        <li>In mBnL schemes, a pattern of m data elements is encoded as a pattern of n signal elements
            in which 2m<=Ln.</li>
        <li>Example: 2B1Q</li>
            <p>Two binary, one quaternary (2B1Q), uses data patterns of size 2 and encodes the 2-bit
            patterns as one signal element belonging to a four-level signal. In this type of encoding m=2,
            n=1, and L=4 (quatemary). Below figure shows an example of a 2B1Q signal</p>
