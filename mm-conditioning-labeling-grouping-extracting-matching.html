    <h3>Conditioning</h3>
    <p>Conditioning is based on a model that suggests the observed image is composed of an
        informative pattern modified by uninteresting variations that typically add to or multiply the
        informative pattern. Conditioning estimates the informative pattern on the basis of the observed
        image. Thus conditioning suppresses noise, which can be thought of as random unpatterned
        variations affecting all measurements.</p>
        <h3>Labeling</h3>
        <p>Labeling is based on a model that suggests the informative pattern has structure as a
            spatial arrangement of events, each spatial event being a set of connected pixels. Labeling
            determines in what kinds of spatial events each pixel participates. An example of a labeling
            operation is edge detection. Edge detection is an important part of the recognition process.</p>
            <p>Edge detection recognizes many edges, but not all of them are significant. Therefore,
                another labeling operation must occur after edge detection, namely thresholding. Thresholding
                specifies which edges should be accepted and which should not; the thresholding operation
                filters only the significant edges from the image and labels them. Other edges are removed.</p>
        <h3>Grouping</h3>
        <p>The labeling operation labels the kinds of primitive spatial events in which the pixel
            participates. The grouping operation identifies the events by collecting together or identifying
            maximal connected sets of pixels participating in the same kind of event. A grouping operation,
            where edges are grouped into lines, is called line-fitting.</p>
        <h3>Extracting</h3>
        <p>The extracting operation computes for each group of pixels a list of properties. Example,
            properties might include its centroid, area, orientation, spatial moments, gray tone moments,
            spatial-gray tone moments, circumscribing circle, inscribing circle, and so on. Other properties
            might depend on whether the group is considered a region or an arc. If the group is a region, the
            number of holes might be a useful property. If the group is an arc, average curvature might be a
            useful property.</p>
            <p>Extraction can also measure topological or spatial relationships between two or more
                groupings. For example, an extracting operation may make explicit that two groupings touch, or
                are spatially close, or that one grouping is above another.</p>
                <h3>Matching</h3>
                <p>
                    After the completion of the extracting operation, the events occurring on the image have
been identified and measured. The matching operation determines the interpretation of some
related set of image events, associating these events with some given three-dimensional object or
two-dimensional shape. There are a wide variety of matching operations. The classical example
is template matching, which compares the examined pattern with stored models (templates) of
known patterns and chooses the best match.
