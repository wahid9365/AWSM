<h2>Computer Components</h2>
Any kind of computers consists of HARDWARE and SOFTWARE.
<h3>Hardware:</h3>
Computer hardware is the collection of physical elements that constitutes a computer
system. Computer hardware refers to the physical parts or components of a computer
such as the monitor, mouse, keyboard, computer data storage, hard drive disk (HDD),
system unit (graphic cards, sound cards, memory, motherboard and chips), etc. all of
which are physical objects that can be touched.
<h4>Input Devices</h4>
Input device is any peripheral (piece of computer hardware equipment to provide data
and control signals to an information processing system such as a computer or other
information appliance.<br>
Input device Translate data from form that humans understand to one that the computer
can work with. Most common are keyboard and mouse.

<h4>Output devices</h4>
An output device is any piece of computer hardware equipment used to communicate
the results of data processing carried out by an information processing system (such
as a computer) which converts the electronically generated information into human-
readable form.

<h3>Software:</h3>
Software is a generic term for organized collections of computer data and instructions,
often broken into two major categories: system software that provides the basic non-
task-specific functions of the computer, and application software which is used by
users to accomplish specific tasks.
<h4>Software Types</h4>
<ol type="i">
<li>System software is responsible for controlling, integrating, and managing the
individual hardware components of a computer system so that other software and
the users of the system see it as a functional unit without having to be concerned
with the low-level details such as transferring data from memory to disk, or
rendering text onto a display. Generally, system software consists of an operating
system and some fundamental utilities such as disk formatters, file managers,
display managers, text editors, user authentication (login) and management tools,
and networking and device control software.</li>
<li>Application software is used to accomplish specific tasks other than just running
the computer system. Application software may consist of a single program, such
as an image viewer; a small collection of programs (often called a software
package) that work closely together to accomplish a task, such as a spreadsheet or
text processing system; a larger collection (often called a software suite) of related
but independent programs and packages that have a common user interface or
shared data format, such as Microsoft Office, which consists of closely integrated
word processor, spreadsheet, database, etc.; or a software system, such as a
database management system, which is a collection of fundamental programs that
may provide some service to a variety of other independent applications.</li>
