<h1>Nature of JavaScript</h1>
JavaScript’s nature can be summarized as follows: 
<ul>
<li><u>It’s dynamic :-</u></li>
Many things can be changed. For example, we can freely add and remove properties (fields) of objects after they have been created. And we can directly create objects, without creating an object factory (e.g., a class) first. 
</ul>
<ul>
<li><u>It’s dynamically typed :-</u></li>
Variables and object properties can always hold values of any type. 
</ul>
<ul>
<li><u>It’s functional and object-oriented :-</u></li>
JavaScript supports two programming language paradigms: functional programming (first-class functions, closures, partial application via bind(), built-in map() and reduce() for arrays, etc.) and object-oriented programming (mutable state, objects, inheritance, etc.). 
</ul>
<ul>
<li><u>It fails silently :-</u></li>
JavaScript did not have exception handling until ECMAScript 3. That explains why the language so often fails silently and automatically converts the values of arguments and operands: it initially couldn’t throw exceptions. 
</ul>
<ul>
<li><u>It’s deployed as source code :-</u></li>
JavaScript is always deployed as source code and compiled by JavaScript engines. Source code has the benefits of being a flexible delivery format and of abstracting the differences between the engines. Two techniques are used to keep file sizes small: compression (mainly gzip) and minification (making source code smaller by renaming variables, removing comments, etc.).
</ul>
<ul>
<li><u>It’s part of the web platform :-</u></li>
JavaScript is such an essential part of the web platform (HTML5 APIs, DOM, etc.) that it is easy to forget that the former can also be used without the latter. However, the more JavaScript is used in nonbrowser settings (such as Node.js), the more obvious it becomes. 
</ul>
