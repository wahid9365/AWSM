    <h3>Data and Signals</h3>
    <article>
        <h3>Analog Data</h3>
        The term analog data refers to information that is continuous. For example, an analog
        clock that has hour, minute, and second hands gives information in a continuous form; the
        movements of the hands are continuous. Analog data, such as the sounds made by a human
        voice, take on continuous values.

        <h3>Digital Data</h3>
        The digital data refers to information that has discrete states. Digital data take on discrete
values. For example, data are stored in computer memory in the form of Os and 1s. They can be
converted to a digital signal or modulated into an analog signal for transmission across a
medium.

        <h3>Analog Signals</h3>
        Analog signals can have a infinite number of values in a range. As the wave moves from
value A to value B, it passes through and includes an infinite number of values along its path.<br>

        <h3>Digital Signals</h3>
        Digital signals can have only a limited number

        <h3>Periodic and Nonperiodic Signals</h3>
        A periodic signal completes a pattern within a measurable time frame, called a period, and
repeats that pattern over subsequent identical periods. The completion of one full pattern is
called a cycle. A nonperiodic signal changes without exhibiting a pattern or cycle that repeats
over time.
<p>In data communications, we commonly use periodic analog signals and nonperiodic
    digital signals</p>

        <h3>Periodic Analog Signal</h3>
        Periodic analog signals can be classified as simple or composite. A simple periodic
analog signal, a sine wave, cannot be decomposed into simpler signals. A composite periodic
analog signal is composed of multiple sine waves.

        <h3>Sine Wave</h3>
        The sine wave is the most fundamental form of a periodic analog signal. When we
visualize it as a simple oscillating curve, its change over the course of a cycle is smooth and
consistent, a continuous, rolling flow. Below Figure shows a sine wave.<br>

<p>A sine wave can be represented by three parameters: the peak amplitude, the frequency, and the
phase.</p>

        <h3>Peak Amplitude</h3>
        The peak amplitude of a signal is the absolute value of its highest intensity, proportional
to the energy it carries. For electric signals, peak amplitude is normally measured in volts. Below
Figure shows two signals and their peak amplitudes.

        <h3>Period and Frequency</h3>
        Period refers to the amount of time, in seconds, a signal needs to complete 1 cycle.
Frequency refers to the number of periods in 1 s. Period is the inverse of frequency, and
frequency is the inverse of period, as the following formulas show.

        <h3>Phase</h3>
        The term phase describes the position of the waveform relative to time 0. If we think of
the wave as something that can be shifted backward or forward along the time axis, phase
describes the amount of that shift. It indicates the status of the first cycle.
<p>Phase is measured in degrees or radians [360¬∞ is 2œÄ rad; 1¬∞ is 2œÄ/360 rad, and 1 rad is
    360/(2œÄ)]. A phase shift of 360¬∞ corresponds to a shift of a complete period; a phase shift of 180¬∞
    corresponds to a shift of one-half of a period; and a phase shift of 90¬∞ corresponds to a shift of
    one-quarter of a period</p>

        <h3>Wavelength</h3>
        The wavelength is the distance a simple signal can travel in one period. Wavelength can
be calculated if one is given the propagation speed (the speed of light) and the period of the
signal.
<p>However, since period and frequency are related to each other, if we represent
    wavelength by ùúÜ, propagation speed by c (speed of light), and frequency by f, we get

    A=C/F

        <h3>Composite Signal</h3>
        The composite signal is a combination of simple sine waves with different frequencies,
        amplitudes and phases.
        <p>If the composite signal is periodic, the decomposition gives a signal with discrete
            frequencies. On nonperiodic, composite signal gives a combination of sine waves with
            continuous frequencies.</p> 
            A normal human being can create a continuous range of frequencies between 0 to 4 Khz.

    <h3>Bandwidth</h3>
    The range of frequencies contained in a composite signal is its bandwidth. The bandwidth is
    normally a difference between two numbers. For example, if a composite signal contains
    frequencies between 1000 and 5000, its bandwidth is 5000 - 1000, or 4000. The bandwidth of a
    composite signal is the difference between the highest and the lowest frequencies contained in
    that signal.   
    <p>Below Figure shows the concept of bandwidth. The figure depicts two composite signals,
        one periodic and the other nonperiodic. The bandwidth of the periodic signal contains all integer
        frequencies between 1000 and 5000 (1000, 100 I, 1002, ...). The bandwidth of the nonperiodic
        signals has the same range, but the frequencies are continuous</p>
