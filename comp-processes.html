<h2>Computer Processes</h2>
The Computer system has mainly 3 parts that is :
<ol><li>Input Unit</li>
<li>central processing unit (CPU)</li>
<li>Output Unit</li></ol>
<h3>Explanation of Computer Processes:</h3>
<ol type="i">
<li><h4>Input Unit :-</h4> An Input Unit accept the input from the outside world. There are many kinds of
input devices like Keyboard , Mouse etc.<br><br>
There are mainly 3 functions of input device are as follows:
<ol><li>It accepts (or reads) instructions and data from outside world.</li>
<li>It converts these instructions and data in computer acceptable form.</li>
<li>It supplies the converted instructions and data to the computer system for further processing.</li></ol></
</li>
<li><h4>CPU :-</h4> It is responsible for processing all the Instruction which is given to computer system or
PC. The CPU is known as the heart /Brain of a computer because without the necessary action
taken by the CPU the user cannot get the desired output.</p>
The Central processing unit (CPU) again consists of 3 parts:-
<ol><li>ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) :- It performs simple arithmetic operation such as +,
<, =<, <= etc.</li>
<li>CU (Control Unit) :- It manages the various components of the computer. It reads instructions from memory
and interpretation and changes in a series of signals to activate other parts of the computer. It
controls and co-ordinate the input output memory and all other units.</li>
<li>Memory Unit : – Memory is used to store data and instructions before and after processing.
There are 2 types of memory unit called Primary memory or internal memory and Secondary
memory.</li></ol>
There are many functions of CPU that is as follows:-
<ul><li>It controls all the parts of software and data flow of computer.</li>
<li>It performs all operations.</li>
<li>It accepts data from input device.</li>
<li>It sends information to output device.</li>
<li>Executing programs stored in memory.</li>
<li>It stores data either temporarily or permanent basis.</li>
<li>It performs arithmetical and logical operations.</li></ul></li>
<li><h4>Output Unit :-</h4> An Output Unit accept the output from the CPU. There are many kinds of output
devices like Monitor, Printer etc.<br><br>
There are mainly 3 functions of output device are as follows:-
<ol><li>It accepts the results produced by the computer, which are in coded form and hence, cannot be
easily understood by us.</li>
<li>It converts these coded results to human acceptable (readable) form.</li>
<li>It supplies the converted results to outside world.</li></ol>
</li></ol>
