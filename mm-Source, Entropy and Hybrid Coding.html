    <h3>Source, Entropy and Hybrid Coding</h3>
    <p>Compression techniques can be categorized as shown in Table below. We distinguish
        among three types of coding: entropy, source, and hybrid coding. Entropy coding is a lossless
        process, while source coding is often lossy. Most multimedia systems use hybrid techniques
        which are combination of the two.</p>
        <p>Table: Overview of some coding and compression techniques.</p>

        <h3>Entropy Coding</h3>
        <p>Entropy coding can be used for different media regardless of the mediumâ€™s specific
            characteristics. The data to be compressed are viewed as a sequence of digital data values, and
            their semantics are ignored. It is lossless because the data prior to encoding is identical to the
            data after decoding; no information is lost. Thus run-length encoding, for example, can be used for compression of any type of data in a file system, for example, text, still images for facsimile,
            or as part of motion picture or audio coding.</p>
            <h3>Source Coding</h3>
            <p>Source coding takes into account the semantics of the information to be encoded. The
                degree of compression that can be reached by source encoding depends on the data contents. In
                the case of lossy compression, a relation exists between the uncoded data and the decoded data;
                the data streams are similar but not identical. The characteristics of the medium can be exploited.
                In the case of speech, a considerable reduction of the amount of data can be achieved by
                transforming the time-dependent signal into the frequency domain, followed by an encoding of
                the formants.</p>
                <p>In the case of still images, spatial redundancies can be used for compression through a
                    content prediction technique. Other techniques perform a transformation of the spatial domain
                    into the two-dimensional frequency domain by using the cosine transform. Low frequencies
                    define the average color, and the information of higher frequencies contains the sharp edges.
                    Hence, low frequencies are much more important than the higher frequencies, a feature that can
                    be used for compression.</p>
