    <h3>Computer Technology</h3>
    <p>A multimedia system is comprised of both hardware and software components, but the
        major driving force behind a multimedia development is research and development in hardware
        capabilities. For example, Compact Disks with their high storage capacity at a relatively low
        price provided the first step toward multimedia storage capabilities</p>
    <p>Multimedia computer technology is a necessary but not sufficient pre-condition for
        multimedia. Unfortunately, computer hardware technology advances faster than the equivalent
        software. For example, many powerful computers with several signal-processors and RISC-
        processors have been built, but the capabilities of these processors are supported only very rarely
        by the current operating systems.</p>
    <p>Besides the multimedia hardware capabilities of current personal computers (PCs) and
        workstations, computer networks with their increasing throughput and, speed start to offer
        services which support multimedia communication systems. Also in this area, computer
        networking technology advances faster than the software. Today there are commercially-
        available computer networks with a throughput of over 100 MB/s, but full integration of high-
        speed networks and multimedia .PCs or workstations are either missing or available only in
        research laboratories.</p>
        <h3>Communication Architecture</h3>
        <p>Local multimedia systems (i.e., multimedia workstations) frequently include a network
            interface (e.g., Ethernet card) through which they can communicate with each other. However,
            the transmission of audio and video cannot be carried out with only the conventional
            communication infrastructure and network adapters.</p>
            <p>The continuous and discrete media have been considered in different environments for
                the transmission of audio and video, independently of each other. For example, on the one hand,
                the analog telephone system provides audio transmission services using its original dial devices
                connected by copper wires to the telephone company's nearest end office. The end offices are
                connected to switching centers, called toll offices, and these centers are connected through high
                bandwidth intertoll trunks to intermediate switching offices. This hierarchical structure allows
                for reliable audio communication. On the other hand: digital computer networks provide data
                transmission services at lower data rate` using network adapters connected by copper wires to
                switches and routers</p>
                <P>The professional radio and television studios transmit audio and video streams in the
                    form of analog signals, although most network components (e.g., switches), over which these signals are transmitted, work internally in a digital mode. Below Figure shows an analog and a
                    digital environment without any interaction.</P>
