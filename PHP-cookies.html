<h2>Cookies in PHP</h2>
Cookie is a small piece of information stored as a file in the user's browser by the web
server. Once created, cookie is sent to the web server as header information with every HTTP
request. We can use cookie to save any data but it should not exceed 1K(1024 bytes) in size.
Use of Cookies
<ol>
<li>To store user information like when he/she visited, what pages were visited on the
website etc, so that next time the user visits our website we can provide a better user
experience.</li>
<li>To store basic website specific information to know this is not the first visit of user.</li>
<li>We can use cookies to store number of visits or view counter.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Types of Cookies</h3>
There are two types of cookies, they are:
<ol>
<li>Session Cookie: This type of cookies are temporary and are expire as soon as the session
ends or the browser is closed.</li>
<li>Persistent Cookie: To make a cookie persistent we must provide it with an expiration
time. Then the cookie will only expire after the given expiration time, until then it will be
a valid cookie.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Creating a Cookie in PHP</h3>
In PHP we can create/set a cookie using the setcookie() function.
<p>Below we have the syntax for the function,</p>
<pre>
	setcookie(name, value, expire, path, domain, secure)
</pre>
The first argument which defines the name of the cookie is mandatory, rest all are optional
arguments. Let's understand what are the available arguments that we can supply to
the setcookie() function to set a cookie.
<table width="50%">
<tr><th width="20%">Argument</th><th>Purpose</th></tr>
<tr><td width="20%">Name</td><td>Used to specify the name of the cookie. It is a mandatory argument.Name of the cookie must be a string</td></tr>
<tr><td width="20%">Value</td><td>Used to store any value in the cookie. It is generally saved as a pair with name. For example, name is userid and value is 7007, the userid for any user</td></tr>
<tr><td width="20%">Expire</td><td>Used to set the expiration time for a cookie. if we do not provide any value, the cookie will be treated as a session cookie and will expire when the browser is closed</td></tr>
<tr><td width="20%">Path</td><td>Used to set a web URL in the cookie. If set, the cookie will be accessible only from that URL. To make a cookie accessible through a domain, set '/' as cookie path</td></tr>
<tr><td width="20%">Domain</td><td>The domain of our web application. It can be used to limit access of cookie for sub-domains. For example, if you set the domain value as www.studytonight.com, then the cookie will be inaccessible from blog.studytonight.com</td></tr>
<tr><td width="20%">Secure</td><td>If we set this to 1, then the cookie will be available and sent only over HTTPS connection</td></tr>
</table>
<h3>Updating Cookie in PHP</h3>
To update/modify a cookie, simply set it again. For example, if we want to update the
username stored in the cookie created, we can do it using setcookie() method again,
<pre>
< ?php
// updating the cookie
setcookie("username", "iamNOTabhishek", time()+60*60*24*7);
? >
< html >
< body >
< ?php
// check if the cookie exists
if(isset($_COOKIE["username"]))
{
	echo "Cookie set with value: ".$_COOKIE["username"];
}
else
{
	echo "cookie not set!";
}
? >
< /body >
< /html >
</pre>
<h3>Delete a Cookie in PHP</h3>
To delete/remove a cookie, we need to expire the cookie, which can be done by updating
the cookie using the setcookie() function with expiration date in past.
<pre>
< ?php
// updating the cookie
setcookie("username", "iamNOTabhishek", time() - 3600);
? >
< html >
< body >
< ?php
echo "cookie username is deleted!";
? >
< /body >
< /html >
</pre>
<h2>Sessions in PHP</h2>
To store information accessible across web pages, we use sessions. Session is not stored
on the user browser like cookie, hence it is a more secure option.
<p>Let's take a practical example, when we log into our facebook account, by providing our
email address and password, until and unless we logout, the web application remembers who we
are and display what our friends are posting and liking on our News Feed, we can update our
profile, send someone message, join a group etc, this is accomplished by Session.</p>
When a user logs into their account on any web application, a session is created for them,
and in the session their username or userid or some other unique identifier is stored, which is
then used on the consecutive webpages to show information specific to that user. On logout, the
session is destroyed.
<p>Session is not limited by any size limit, we can store any information in the session,
irrespective of its size.</p>
<h3>Use of Session</h3>
<ol>
<li>Web applications which require a user to login, use session to store user information, so
that on every webpage related information can be displayed to the user.</li>
<li>In eCommerce websites, shopping cart is geberally saved as part of session.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Start a Session in PHP</h3>
In PHP we can start a session by using the session_start() function. And data is stored in
the session using session variable, which can be assigned different values using global
variable $_SESSION
<p>In simpler words, using the function session_start() we initialize the session, in which we can
store information using the session variable $_SESSION.<p>
Let's take an example, below we have a webpage with Php file named first_page.php
<pre>
< ?php
// start the session
session_start();
// set the session variable
$_SESSION["username"] = "iamabhishek";
$_SESSION["userid"] = "1";
? >
< html >
< body >
< ?php
echo "Session variable is set.";
? >
< a href="second_page.php" >Go to Second Page< /a >
< /body >
< /html >
</pre>
<h3>Getting PHP Session Variable Values</h3>
In the code above, we have started a session and set two session variables. Above webpage will
also have a link to navigate to Second page second_page.php.
<p>Below is the code for second_page.php, in which we fetch values from the session variable
which are set in the first_page.php.</p>
<pre>
< ?php
// start the session
session_start();
// get the session variable values
$username = $_SESSION["username"];
$userid = $_SESSION["userid"];
? >
< html >
< body >
< ?php
echo "Username is: ".$username."< br/ >";
echo "User id is: ".$userid;
? >
< /body >
< /html >
</pre>
<b>Output:</b>
<pre>
Username is: iamabhishek
User id is: 1
</pre>
session_start() function is used to initialize a new session and to fetch the ongoing session(if
already started), and then, using the $_SESSION global variable, we can either set new values
into the session or get the saved values.
<h3>Update Session Variable in PHP</h3>
To update any value stored in the session variable, start the session by
calling session_start() function and then simply overwrite the value to update session variable.
<pre>
< ?php
// start the session
session_start();
// update the session variable values
$_SESSION["userid"] = "1111";
? >
< html >
< body >
< ?php
echo "Username is: ".$username."<br/>";
echo "User id is: ".$userid;
? >
< /body >
< /html >
</pre>
<b>Output:</b>
<pre>
Username is: iamabhishek
User id is: 1111
We just updated the value of userid in the session variable from 1 to 1111.
</pre>
<h3>Destroy a Session in PHP</h3>
To clean the session variable or to remove all the stored values from the session variable
we can use the function session_unset() and to destroy the session, we
use session_destroy() function.
<pre>
< ?php
// start the session
session_start();
? >
< html >
< body >
< ?php
// clean the session variable
session_unset();
// destroy the session
session_destroy();
? >
< /body >
< /html >
</body>
