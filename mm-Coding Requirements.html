    <h3>Coding Requirements</h3>
    <p>Images have considerably higher storage requirements than text, and audio and video have still
        more demanding properties for data storage. Moreover, transmitting continuous media also
        requires substantial communication data rates.</p>
        <p>In order to be able to compare the different data storage and bandwidth requirements of
            various visual media (text, graphics, images, and video), the following specifications are based
            on a small window of 640×480 pixels on a display.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>For the representation of the text medium, two bytes are used for every 8×8 pixel
                    character.</li>
                    <img src="pixel char.png" alt="pixel char" width="700" height="400">
                <li>For the representation of vector images, a typical image consists of 500 lines. Each line
                    is defined by its coordinates in the x direction and the y direction, and by an 8-bit
                    attribute field. Coordinates in the x direction require 10 bits (log2 (640)), while
                    coordinates in the y direction require 9 bits (log2 (480)).</li>
                    <img src="bits per line.png" alt="bits per line" width="700" height="400">  
                <li>Individual pixels of a bitmap can be coded using 256 different colors, requiring a single
                    byte per pixel.</li>
              
            </ol>
