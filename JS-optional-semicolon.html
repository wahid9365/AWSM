<h1>Optional Semicolon</h1>
Semicolons are used in JavaScript to separate statements from each other. But you can also omit the semicolon between two statements if those statements are written on separate lines.
<br>
<pre>
Right:	x = 7 	  AND 	x = 7;	 AND x = 3; z = 7;
	z = 3; 	      	z = 3;
</pre>
Since the two statements appear on separate line, line break is sufficient to tell these are two different statements. Semicolon before the line break is optional.
<pre>
Wrong:	x = 7   z = 3;
</pre>
Here, both statements are on same line but there is no way to differentiate between them. Therefore, a semicolon after first statement is required here.
