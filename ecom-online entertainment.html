<h3>What is an online entertainment?</h3>
Downloading, playing, and enjoying entertainment media (such as games,
music, and video) from the Internet.
<p>Many factors are helping Online Entertainment Platforms perform so well. Here
are some :
<ol>
<li><b>Fresh Content –</b><br>
As all we know, content is a king. The audience was bored and tired watching
the same typical content like full of melodramatic daily soaps, (so-called) reality
shows, romance-oriented typical shows and all. These platforms served fresh
content to all tired and bored audiences to get charged up and attracted. The
most important thing to find fresh content is to go to meetings with like-minded
people. To do this, you need to hire car Edinburgh airport and find the latest
meeting on the topic of marketing.</li>
<li><b>Ease of access –</b><br>
In a busy world, everyone can’t manage some of his time to go to movie
theatres sit there for more than 2 hours, and watch a movie. In a life that
remains only on weekends, people don’t wish to rush to theatres making way
from traffic. These platforms came up as a solution. They brought the best of
the content on your figure tips. Now you can watch your favorite movie or
binge-watch your favorite or trending shows while sitting on a couch in your
living room, while traveling, or even in a washroom.</li>
<li><b>Marketing –</b><br>
These services have the best of the marketing guys. As their product is
completely digital, they must focus on digital marketing more than offline ones.
The recently launched Netflix’s Hindi Production Sacred Games can be
considered as one of the best promoted content on online entertainment
platforms. They came up powerfully with new ways of digital marketing like
creating memes, Facebook pages, creative Google, YouTube ads and made
hype for more than a year. Netflix kept 100 Cr rupees revenue from this
particular show in mind.
<li><b>Affordable rates-</b><br>
If you watch a movie in the theatre you need to pay the amount which can buy
at least a full meal for you. Instead of wasting this much amount, people think
about investing a little more amount on an annual subscription on online
entertainment platforms. You can also share your subscription with your limited
family members and friends. You can even watch TV for free! Cable

<li><b>Target Audience –</b><br>
All these platforms know their target audience very well. Focusing on the age of
every user they have uploaded data for each one. They have sci-fi, comedy,
clean and watch with family movies & shows, content for kids, etc. With the
help of machine learning, they suggest appropriate content in which the viewer
is interested in these online entertainment platforms. This customized user
experience makes the viewer more comfortable and feels homely.</li>
<li><b>An open platform for all kinds of creativity-</b><br>
Many nations have their film certification boards. Censorship filters content
based on Nudity, use of animals while making, explicit dialogues, etc. Many
people say censorship is a curse for creativity. Those who believe in cinema are
a mirror of society, they want to show how really society is. Whether in a
positive or negative shade. Such platforms don’t have any kind of censorship.
This is a key point where viewers, cinema enthusiasts get attracted to.
Censorship filters content based on nudity, use of animals while making,
explicit dialogues, etc.</li>
