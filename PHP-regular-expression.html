<h2>Regular Expression in PHP</h2>
A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. When we search for data in a text, we can use this search pattern to describe what we are searching for. A regular expression can be a single character, or a more complicated pattern.
<p>Regular expressions can be used to perform all types of text search and text replace operations.</p>
<b>Syntax</b>
<br>In PHP, regular expressions are strings composed of delimiters, a pattern and optional modifiers.
<pre>$exp = "/w3schools/i";</pre>
In the example above, / is the delimiter, w3schools is the pattern that is being searched
for, and i is a modifier that makes the search case-insensitive.
<h3>Advantages and uses of Regular expressions:</h3>
In many scenarios, developers face problems whenever data are collected in free text fields as most of the programming deals with data entries. Regular expressions are used almost everywhere in today’s application programming.
<ul>
<li>Regular expressions help in validation of text strings which are of programmer’s interest.</li>
<li>It offers a powerful tool for analyzing, searching a pattern and modifying the text data.</li>
<li>It helps in searching specific string pattern and extracting matching results in a flexible manner.</li>
<li>It helps in parsing text files looking for a defined sequence of characters for further analysis or data manipulation.</li>
<li>With the help of in-built regexes functions, easy and simple solutions are provided for identifying patterns.</li>
<li>It effectively saves a lot of development time, which are in search of specific string pattern.</li>
<li>It helps in important user information validations like email address, phone numbers and IP address.</li>
<li>It helps in highlighting special keywords in a file based on search result or input.</li>
<li>It helps in identifying specific template tags and replacing those data with the actual data as per the requirement.</li>
<li>Regexes are very useful for creation of HTML template system recognizing tags.</li>
<li>Regexes are mostly used for browser detection, spam filtration, checking password strength and form validations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Regular Expression Functions</h3>
PHP provides a variety of functions that allow you to use regular expressions.
<br>The preg_match(), preg_match_all() and preg_replace() functions are some of the most commonly used ones:
<table width="40%">
<tr><th>Function</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>preg_match()</td><td>Returns 1 if the pattern was found in the string and 0 if not</td></tr>
<tr><td>preg_match_all()</td><td>Returns the number of times the pattern was found in the string, which may also be 0</td></tr>
<tr><td>preg_replace()</td><td>Returns a new string where matched patterns have been replaced with another string</td></tr>
</table>
<h4>Using preg_match()</h4>
The preg_match() function will tell we whether a string contains matches of a pattern.
<br>Example: Use a regular expression to do a case-insensitive search for "w3schools" in a string:
<pre>
< ?php
$str = "Visit W3Schools";
$pattern = "/w3schools/i";
echo preg_match($pattern, $str); // Outputs 1
? >
</pre>
<h4>Using preg_match_all()</h4>
The preg_match_all() function will tell you how many matches were found for a pattern in a string.
<br>Example: Use a regular expression to do a case-insensitive count of the number of occurrences of "ain" in a string:
<pre>
< ?php
$str = "The rain in SPAIN falls mainly on the plains.";
$pattern = "/ain/i";
echo preg_match_all($pattern, $str); // Outputs 4
? >
</pre>
<h4>Using preg_replace()</h4>
The preg_replace() function will replace all of the matches of the pattern in a string with another string.
<br>Example : Use a case-insensitive regular expression to replace Microsoft with W3Schools in a string:
<pre>
< ?php
$str = "Visit Microsoft!";
$pattern = "/microsoft/i";
echo preg_replace($pattern, "W3Schools", $str); // Outputs "Visit W3Schools!"
? >
</pre>
