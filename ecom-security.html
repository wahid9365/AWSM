<h2>E-commerce Security</h2>
E-commerce security is the protection of e-commerce assets from unauthorized access,
use, alteration, or destruction. It requires a reliable infrastructure and framework to enable
a secure and successful ecommerce business. The most common security breach
for the ecommerce website is concerned with Integrity, Availability, Confidentiality,
Non-repudiation, Authenticity, and Privacy.
<h3>Importance of E-security</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Assets Protection :</b> Electronic security is one of the cheapest prevention
measures to protect our business and personal assets such as money, furniture
and even intellectual property being under strict non -disclosure conditions. In
simple words, electronic security will protect us from both external and
internal theft.</li>
<li><b>Instant security updates :</b> Modern electronic security systems can be accessed
through different electronic devices such as computers, tablets or mobile
phones. With novel technology and cloud systems, we can be aware of the
situation wherever we are: at home, on vacation, or commuting. With instant
security alerts on our phone, we can find out about a security breach within
seconds.</li>
<li><b>Protection when premises unattended :</b> Modern technology implemented in
electronic security systems allow us to travel for longer periods of time.
Complex security codes and accessibility to CCTV Security
Cameras anywhere in the world can help protect our business information and
assets while we’re travelling.</li>
<li><b>Conflict resolution :</b> Integrated security systems including CCTV security
cameras, access control systems, security alarms and security officers can
provide important evidence whether a problem arises in the workplace,
regardless if it is an internal or external robbery/break-ins.</li>
<li><b>Monitoring high-risk areas :</b> Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) Cameras may
be placed in areas where risk is high. we can install these cameras in places
that are vulnerable to vandalism, theft or break ins.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Six Dimensions of Ecommerce Security</h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Integrity</b>
<br>Integrity can ensure that information on the internet has not been altered in any
way by an unauthorized party. It maintains the consistency, accuracy, and
trustworthiness of the information over its entire life cycle.</li>
<li><b>Non-repudiation</b>
<br>Non-repudiation confirms whether the information sent between the two parties
was received or not. It ensures that the purchase cannot be denied by the person
who completed the transaction. In other words, it’s an assurance that anyone
cannot deny the validity of transaction.</li>
<li><b>Authenticity</b>
<br>In ecommerce, since both the customer and seller need to trust each other, they must
remain as who they are in real. Both the seller and buyer must provide proof of their
original identity so that the ecommerce transaction can happen securely between them.</li>
<li><b>Confidentiality</b>
Confidentiality refers to protecting information from being accessed by an
unauthorized person on the internet. In other words, only the people who are
authorized can gain access to view or modify or use the sensitive data of any
customer or merchants.</li>
<li><b>Privacy</b>
<br>Where confidentiality is a concern about the information present during
communication, privacy is concerned with personal details. In general, privacy is
used to control the usage of information by the customers that they have given to
the merchant.</li>
<li><b>Availability</b>
<br>Continuous availability of the data is the key to provide a better customer
experience in ecommerce. The continuous availability of the ecommerce website
increases online visibility, search engine rankings, and site traffic. Data which is
present on the website must be secured and available 24x7x 365 for the customer
without downtime. If it is not, it will be difficult to gain a competitive edge and
survive in the digital world.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Web Security issues related to E-commerce</h3>
The potential security issues related to e-commerce are as follows:
<ul>
<li>It is possible for an attacker to eavesdrop the communication between a user’s
browser and a web server.</li>
<li>Sensitive information, such as a credit card number, or any other confidential
data, could thus be obtained.</li>
<li>An attacker could try to impersonate entities in order to get information, which is
normally not disclosed without authorization.</li>
<li>A substantial amount of confidential information is made available via the www.
Any unauthorized access to this information should be prevented.</li>
<li>As people are getting more and more online, their privacy is at stake; the web
includes ideal technologies with which user profiles can be maintained.</li>
</ul>
