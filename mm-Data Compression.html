    <h3>Data Compression</h3>
    <p>Data compression is a reduction in the number of bits needed to represent data.
        Compressing data can save storage capacity, speed up file transfer, and decrease costs for storage
        hardware and network bandwidth.</p>
        <p>Compression is performed by a program that uses a formula or algorithm to determine
            how to shrink the size of the data. Data compression can dramatically decrease the amount of
            storage a file takes up. For example, in a 2:1 compression ratio, a 20 megabyte (MB) file takes
            up 10 MB of space. As a result of compression, administrators spend less money and less time
            on storage.</p>
            <h3>Storage Space</h3>
            <p>Uncompressed graphics, audio, and video data require substantial storage capacity, which
                is not possible in the case of uncompressed video data, even given todayâ€™s CD and DVD
                technology. The same is true for multimedia communications. Data transfer of uncompressed
                video data over digital networks requires that very high bandwidth be provided for a single
                point-to-point communication. To be cost-effective and feasible, multimedia systems must use
                compressed video and audio streams.</p>
