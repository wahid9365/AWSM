    <h3>Traditional data stream characteristics</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In distributed multi-media communication system, data of discrete and
continuous media are transmitted and information exchange takes place.</li>
<li>In each digital system, transmitted information is divided into individual
units (called as packets) and subsequently sent away from one system component
to another. </li>
<li>A sequence of individual packets transmitted in a time-dependent fashion is
called a data stream. </li>
<li>Packets can carry information of either continuous or discrete media. An
example of continuous media data stream is the transmission of speech in a
telephone system. </li>
<li>The retrieval of document from a database is the example of discrete media
data stream. </li></ul>
