<h3>Word Processing</h3>
Word processing is an application program that allows us to create letters, reports,
newsletters, tables, form letters, brochures, and Web pages. Using this application program
we can add pictures, tables, and charts to our documents. We can also check spelling and
grammar.
<h4>The main features of word processing are:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>We can create professional documents fast, using built-in and custom templates.</li>
    <li>We can easily manage large documents using various features like the ability to create
        table of contents, index, and cross-references.</li>
    <li>We can work on multiple documents simultaneously.</li>
    <li>With the help of mail merge, we can quickly create merge documents like mass
        mailings or mailing labels.</li>
    <li>AutoCorrect and AutoFormat features catch typographical errors automatically and
        allow us to use predefined shortcuts and typing patterns to quickly format our
        documents.</li>
    <li>The print zoom facility scales a document on different paper sizes, and allows you to
        print out multiple pages on a single sheet of paper.</li>
    <li>The nested tables feature supports putting one table inside another table.</li>
    <li>We can export and save your word documents in PDF and XPS file format.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Use of MS word</h4>
    <h4>Using Word for Letters and Mailings</h4>
    Businesses typically use Word to manage their outgoing correspondence needs. For
example, we can use the program to create a single letter at a time or to create a mailmerge
that sends a letter to some or all of our customers.
<h4>Using Word to Create Documents and Forms</h4>
We can use Word to create just about any kind of business document, including
company reports, presentations, budgets, proposals and plans. Word's design features are easy
to use, enabling us to use data visualization tools to add tables, charts and graphs to our
documents. Its SmartArt function uses graphics to communicate information.
<h4>Using Word to Produce Promotional Materials</h4>
We can use Word to create promotional and marketing materials that we send out to
customers and prospects. Common options include brochures, flyers and newsletters.
<h4>Using Word to Build Branding</h4>
If we want our employees to use a standardized letter or memo format, we can design
one and save it as a template that the entire company can use. We can use styles and themes
to define exactly how all of our business documents will look, giving you a consistency of
color, fonts and effects i.e. a consistency of branding.
<h4>Desktop Publishing</h4>
People often use Word's extensive formatting features to create professional
newsletters. Word is not as powerful as Microsoft Publisher, but we can manipulate text,
insert headings, create borders, add tables and move images wherever we like using Word.
<h4>Templates</h4>
Microsoft makes free templates available to Word users. A template is a blueprint
used as a starting point to create other documents. If we need a calendar or budget report, for
instance, use Word's template search feature to find and download one of those templates.
<h4>STARTING MS WORD PROGRAM</h4>
We can start our Word program different ways. One way is using Start button:
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman">
    <li>Click on the Start button.</li>
    <li>In the menu that appears select All ProgramsMicrosoft OfficeMicrosoft
        Office Word 2007.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Create a New Document</h4>
To open a new document, follow one of the following methods:
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman">
    <li>Click the New Document button on the menu bar</li>
    <li>Press CTRL+N keys on the keyboard.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Open an Existing Document</h4>
Click on the office 2007 button at the top left corner of your screen to open an
existing document, follow one of the following methods:
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman">
    <li>Click the Open File button on the menu bar.</li>
