    <h3>Graphics Hardware- Input</h3>
    <p>Current input technology provides us with the ubiquitous mouse, the data tablet and the
        transparent, touch-sensitive panel mounted on the screen. Some common input devices are track-
        balls, space-balls or the data glove.</p>
        <p>Track-balls can be made to sense rotation about the vertical axis in addition to that about
            the two horizontal axes. A space-ball is a rigid sphere containing strain gauges. The user pushes
            or pulls the sphere in any direction, providing 3D translation and orientation. The data glove
            records hand position and orientation as well as finger movements. It is a glove covered with
            small, lightweight sensors. Each sensor is a short length of fiber-optic cable, with a light-
            Emitting Diode (LED) at one end and a photo transistor at the other.</p>

                <h3>Graphics Hardware- Output</h3>
                <p>Current output technology uses raster display, which store display primitives in a refresh
                    buffer in terms of their component pixels. The architecture of a raster display is shown in below
                    figure.</p>
                    <img src="Architecture of a raster display.png" alt="Architecture of a raster display" width="700" height="400">
    <p>The display controller receives and interprets sequence of output commands. In simpler
        system such as those in personal computers, the display controller exists only as a software
        component of the graphics library package, and the refresh buffer is no more than a piece of the
        CPUâ€Ÿs memory that can be read by the image display subsystem (often called the video
        controller) that produces the actual image on the screen.</p>
        <p>The complete image on a raster display is formed from the raster, which is a set of
            horizontal raster lines, each a row of individual pixels; the raster is thus stored as a matrix of
            pixels representing the entire screen area. The entire image is scanned out sequentially by the
            video controller.</p>
