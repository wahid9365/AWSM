    <h3>Database management system (DBMS)</h3>
    It is a collection of programs that enables user to create and maintain a database. In other words it is
general-purpose software that provides the users with the processes of defining, constructing and manipulating
the database for various applications. The DBMS contains the information about particular enterprise. It
provides an environment that is both convenient and efficient to use. The examples of DBMS are Oracle, IBM
DB2 (IBM), SQL Server (Microsoft), Access (Microsoft), MySQL.
<p>The database and DBMS software together is called as Database system. The applications of database systems
    are in Banking, Airlines, Universities, Sales, and Manufacturing etc.</p>
    <h3>Objectives of DBMS</h3>
    <ol type="i">
        <li>Provide for mass storage of relevant data.</li>
        <li> Make access to the data easy for user.</li>
        <li> Make latest modification to the database available immediately.</li>
        <li> Eliminate redundant data.</li>
        <li>Allow multiple users to be active at one time.</li>
        <li> Provides online maintenance of database.</li>
        <li> Allow multiple and concurrent updating and retrievals.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Benefits of DBMS:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Creations of database files.</li>
        <li>Definitions of database fields</li>
        <li>Easy inclusions of new database fields.</li>
        <li>Creation of screens for input and output</li>
        <li>Creation of report format.</li>
        <li>Rapid sorting and indexing</li>
    </ol>
