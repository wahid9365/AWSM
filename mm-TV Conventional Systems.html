    <h3>Conventional Systems</h3>
    <p>Black-and-white television and current color television is based on the representation range.
        Early on, different video format standards were established in different parts of the world.
        Conventional television systems employ the following standards:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>NTSC:</b> NTSC National Television Systems Committee, developed in the U.S., is the
                oldest and most widely used television standard. â€žThe color carrier is used with
                approximately 4.429 MHz or with approximately 3.57 MHz. NTSC uses a quadrature
                amplitude modulation with a suppressed color carrier and works with a motion frequency
                of approximately 30 Hz. A picture consists of 525 lines.</li>
            <li><b>SECAM:</b>SECAM (Sequenital Couleur Avec Memoire) is a standard used in France and
                Eastern Europe. In contrast to NTSC and PAL, it is based on frequency modulation. It
                uses a motion frequency of 25 Hz, and each Picture has 625lines.</li>
            <li><b>PAL:</b> PAL( Phase Alternating Line) was invented by W. Bruch (Telefunken) in 1963. It
                is used in parts of Western Europe. The basic principle of PAL is a quadrature amplitude
                modulation similar to NTSC, but the color carrier is not suppressed.</li>
            
        </ul>
        <h3>HIGH DEFINITION SYSTEMS</h3>
        <p>The next generation of TV is known as HDTV ( High-Definition Television). HDTV is, in
            principle, defined by the image it presents to the viewer:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Resolution:</b> The HDTV image has approximately twice as many horizontal and vertical
                    pixels as conventional systems. The increased vertical definition is achieved by
                    employing more than 1000 lines in the scanning patterns. The increased luminance detail
                    in the image is achieved by employing a video bandwidth approximately five times that
                    used in conventional systems. Additional bandwidth is used to transmit the color values
                    separately, so that the total bandwidth is from five to eight times that used in existing
                    color television services.</li>
                <li><b>Aspect Ratio:</b> The aspect ratio of the proposed HDTV images is 16/9=1.777.</li>
                <li><b>Viewing Distance:</b> Since the eye's ability to distinguish details is limited, the more
                    detailed HDTV image should be viewed closer than is customary with conventional
                    systems.</li>
                
            </ul>
