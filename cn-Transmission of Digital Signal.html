    <h3>Transmission of Digital Signal</h3>
    We can transmit a digital signal by using one of two different approaches: baseband
    transmission or broadband transmission (using modulation).  
  <article>
    <h3>Baseband Transmission</h3>
    Baseband transmission means sending a digital signal over a channel without changing
the digital signal to an analog signal. Below Figure shows baseband transmission.

<p>Baseband transmission requires that we have a low-pass channel, a channel with a
    bandwidth that starts from zero. This is the case if we have a dedicated medium with a
    bandwidth constituting only one channel. For example, the entire bandwidth of a cable
    connecting two computers is one single channel.</p> 
<article>
    <h3>Broadband Transmission (Using Modulation)</h3>
    Broadband transmission or modulation means changing the digital signal to an analog
    signal for transmission. Modulation allows us to use a bandpass channel-a channel with a
    bandwidth that does not start from zero. This type of channel is more available than a low-pass
    channel. Below Figure shows a bandpass channel.

    <h3>Bit Rate</h3>
    Bit rate is used to describe digital signals. The bit rate is the number of bits sent in 1s, expressed
in bits per second (bps).
<h3>Bit length</h3>
The bit length is the distance one bit occupies on the transmission medium.
<pre>𝐵𝑖𝑡 𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡h = 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝𝑎𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑒𝑑 * 𝑏𝑖𝑡 𝑑𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛</pre>
</article>
<h3>Data Rate Limits</h3>
Data rate depends on three factors:
<ol>
    <li>The bandwidth available</li>
    <li>The level of the signals we use</li>
    <li>The quality of the channel (the level of noise)</li>
</ol>
Two theoretical formulas were developed to calculate the data rate:
<ol type="i">
    <li>Nyquist Bit Rate for a noiseless channel</li>
    <li>Shannon Capacity for a noisy channel.</li>
</ol>
<article>
    <h3>Noiseless Channel: Nyquist Bit Rate</h3>
    For a noiseless channel, the Nyquist bit rate formula defines the theoretical maximum bit
    rate:
    <pre>𝐵𝑖𝑡𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒 = 2 × 𝑏𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑤𝑖𝑑𝑡h × 𝑙𝑜𝑔2𝐿</pre>  
    <p>In this formula, bandwidth is the bandwidth of the channel, L is the number of signal
        levels used to represent data, and BitRate is the bit rate in bits per second.</p>
</article>

    <h3>Noisy Channel: Shannon Capacity</h3>
    In 1944, Claude Shannon introduced a formula, called the Shannon capacity, to
determine the theoretical highest data rate for a noisy channel:
<pre>𝑐𝑎𝑝𝑎𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦 = 𝑏𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑤𝑖𝑑𝑡𝑕 × log2(1 + 𝑆𝑁𝑅)</pre>
<p>In this formula, bandwidth is the bandwidth of the channel, SNR is the signal-to-noise ratio, and
    capacity is the capacity of the channel in bits per second.</p>
