    <title>STRUCTURE OF A CIRCUIT SWITCH and PACKET SWITCH</title>
</head>

    <h3>STRUCTURE OF A CIRCUIT SWITCH</h3>
    Circuit switching today can use either of two technologies:
    <ol>
        <li>The space-division switch or</li>
        <li>The time-division switch.</li>
</ol>
<article>
    <h4>Space-Division Switch</h4>
    In space-division switching, the paths in the circuit are separated from one another
    spatially. This technology was originally designed for use in analog networks but is used
    currently in both analog and digital networks.    
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Crossbar Switch</h4>
        A crossbar switch connects n inputs to m outputs in a grid, using electronic micro-
switches (transistors) at each crosspoint (see Figure below). The major limitation of this
design is the number of crosspoints required. To connect n inputs to m outputs using a
crossbar switch requires n x m crosspoints. For example, to connect 1000 inputs to 1000
outputs requires a switch with 1,000,000 crosspoints. A crossbar with this number of
crosspoints is impractical. Such a switch is also inefficient because statistics show that, in
practice, fewer than 25 percent of the crosspoints are in use at any given time. The rest are
idle.<br>

        <h4>
            Multistage Switch      
        </h4>
        <p>The solution to the limitations of the crossbar switch is the multistage switch, which
combines crossbar switches in several (normally three) stages, as shown in Figure below.</p>
 <img src="Multistage switch.png" alt="Multistage switch" height="300";>
<p>In a single crossbar switch, only one row or column (one path) is active for any
    connection. So we need N x N crosspoints. If we can allow multiple paths inside the switch,
    we can decrease the number of crosspoints. Each crosspoint in the middle stage can be
    accessed by multiple crosspoints in the first or third stage.</p>
</li>
</ul>

    <h4>Time-Division Switch</h4>
    Time-division switching uses time-division multiplexing (TDM) inside a switch. The
most popular technology is called the time-slot interchange (TSI)
<h4>Time-Slot Interchange</h4>
Figure below shows a system connecting four input lines to four output lines. Imagine
that each input line wants to send data to an output line according to the following pattern:
(13), (24), (31) and (42) in which the arrow means “to”.

<p>The figure combines a TDM multiplexer, a TDM demultiplexer, and a TSI consisting of
    random access memory (RAM) with several memory locations. The size of each location is
    the same as the size of a single time slot. The number of locations is the same as the number
    of inputs (in most cases, the numbers of inputs and outputs are equal). The RAM fills up with
    incoming data from time slots in the order received. Slots are then sent out in an order based
    on the decisions of a control unit.</p>

<h3>STRUCTURE OF A PACKET SWITCH</h3>
Packet switch has four components:
<ol>
    <li>Input ports</li>
    <li>Output ports</li>
    <li>Routing processor and</li>
    <li>Switching fabric</li>
</ol>

<article>
    <h3>Input Ports</h3>
    An input port performs the physical and data link functions of the packet switch. The
bits are constructed from the received signal. The packet is decapsulated from the frame.
Errors are detected and corrected. The packet is now ready to be routed by the network layer.
In addition to a physical layer processor and a data link processor, the input port has buffers
(queues) to hold the packet before it is directed to the switching fabric.

    <h3>Output Port</h3>
    The output port performs the same functions as the input port, but in the reverse order.
First the outgoing packets are queued, then the packet is encapsulated in a frame, and finally
the physical layer functions are applied to the frame to create the signal to be sent on the line.

<article>
    <h3>Routing Processor</h3>
    The routing processor performs the functions of the network layer. The destination
address is used to find the address of the next hop and, at the same time, the output port
number from which the packet is sent out. This activity is sometimes referred to as table
lookup because the routing processor searches the routing table.

    <h3>Switching Fabrics</h3>
    The most difficult task in a packet switch is to move the packet from the input queue
to the output queue. The speed with which this is done affects the size of the input/output
queue and the overall delay in packet delivery.
<p>The packet switches are specialized mechanisms that use a variety of switching
fabrics such as crossbar switch, Banyan Switch and Batcher-Banyan Switch</p>
