    <h3>HTTP</h3>
    HTTP represents "Hypertext Transfer Protocol." HTTP is the protocol that can
transfer information over the network. It is the Internet protocol suite method and defines
commands and functions used for sharing web page data.
<p>HTTP uses a server-client model. A client, for example, maybe a laptop or telephone device.
    The HTTP server is frequently a web host running web server software, such as Apache or
    IIS</p>
    <p>The below figure shows the HTTP transaction between client and server. The client initiates
        a transaction by sending a request message to the server. The server replies to the request
        message by sending a response message.</p>

<p>HTTP also represents commands such as GET and POST, which are used to handle
    submissions on websites. The CONNECT command can act as a fast connection that is
    encrypted using a secure socket layer (SSL).</p>
<h3>FTP</h3>
FTP means "File Transfer Protocol" and refers to a group of rules that govern how
computers transfer files from one system to another over the internet. Businesses use FTP to
send files between computers, while websites use FTP for the uploading and downloading of
files from their website's servers.
<p>Although transferring files from one system to another is very simple and
    straightforward, but sometimes it can cause problems. For example, two systems may have
    different file conventions. Two systems may have different ways to represent text and data.
    Two systems may have different directory structures. FTP protocol overcomes these
    problems by establishing two connections between hosts. One connection is used for data
    transfer, and another connection is used for the control connection.</p>
    <p>The below figure shows the basic model of the FTP. The FTP client has three components:
        the user interface, control process, and data transfer process. The server has two components:
        the server control process and the server data transfer process.</p>
