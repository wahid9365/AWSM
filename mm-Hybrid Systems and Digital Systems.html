    <title>Hybrid Systems and Digital Systems</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h3>Hybrid Systems</h3>
    <p>By using existing technologies, integration and interaction between analog and digital
        environments can be implemented. This integration approach is called the hybrid approach. The
        main advantage of this approach is the high quality of audio and video and all the necessary
        devices for input, output, storage and transfer that are available. The hybrid approach is used for
        studying application user interfaces, application programming interfaces or application scenarios.
        The different approaches towards hybrid systems are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Integrated Device Control</b>
                One possible integration approach is to provide a control of analog input/output audio-
                video components in the digital environment. Moreover, the connection between the sources
                (e.g., CD player, camera, microphone) and destinations (e.g., video recorder, write-able CD), or
                the switching of audio-video signals can be controlled digitally. Below Figure shows a possible
                computer control and management of external analog components.</li>

                <p>Based on this hybrid approach, the Bell Communication Research Laboratory
                    implemented the Integrated Media Architecture Laboratory (IMAL) in 1987. The IMAL project
                    integrated a number of analog and digital networks [LD87 ].</p>
                   <P> Another example is the Touring Machine SystemTM from the Bellcore Information
                    Networking Research Laboratory. A primary goal of the Touring Machine project to provide a
                    hybrid network infrastructure on which applications requiring complex multimedia
                    communications can be developed, independent of the actual network fabric used to provide
                    transport.</p>
            <li><b>Integrated Transmission Control</b>
                A second possibility to integrate digital and analog components is to provide a common
                transmission control. This approach implies that analog audio-video sources and destinations are
                connected to the computers for control purposes to transmit continuous data over digital
                networks, such as a cable network. Below Figure show a possible system configuration.</li>
                <img src="Continuous data input into a digital network under computer control.png" alt="Continuous data input into a digital network under computer control" width="800" height="200">
                <p>For example, the video services of the MIT Muse and Pygmalion Project are based on
                    such an approach: each computer is connected to the Ethernet for data communication, as well as
                    to the cable network. The audio-video sources and destinations are connected to the computers
                    through a Parallax family of adapters.</p>
            <li><b>Integrated Transmission</b>
                The next possibility to integrated digital and analog components is to provide a common
                transmission network. This implies that, external analog audio-video devices computer, are
                connected to computers using A/D (D/A) converters outside of the computer not only for control,
                but also for processing purposes. Continuous data are transmitted over shared data networks.
                Below Figure shows a possible system configuration.</li>
                <img src="Continuous data of local, external audio-video devices transmitted through the computer..png" alt="Continuous data of local, external audio-video devices transmitted through the computer." width="800" height="200">
                <P>An example of this approach is the DIME project of the IBM European Networking
                    Center. Here, audio-video devices are connected to PS/2 computer through audio and video cards
                    and transmitted over the data network.</P>
        
        </ul>
<h3>Digital Systems</h3>
<h4>Connection to Workstations</h4>
<p>In digital systems, audio-video devices can be connected directly to the computers
    (workstations) and digitized audio-video data are transmitted over shared data networks, Audio-
    video devices in these systems can be either analog or digital. Below Figure shows an integrated
    system structure with analog devices and A/D and D/A interfaces.</p>
    <img src="system structure with analog end-system devices.png" alt="system structure with analog end-system " width="800" height="200">
    <p>An example of a digital system is the Etherphone system from Xerox PARC. A digital
        audio communication was demonstrated over an Ethernet. Another example is an project by
        AT&T in Naporville, which considered a system architecture to a Etherphone. Here, a computer
        was directly Connected to a fast packet switching network. The processing of continuous media
        in the computer was allowed through extension of the UNIX Operating system.</p>
