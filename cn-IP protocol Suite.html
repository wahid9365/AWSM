    <h3>TCP/IP protocol Suite</h3>
    TCP/IP is a hierarchical protocol made up of interactive modules, each of which
    provides a specific functionality. The modules are not necessary interdependent. The OSI
    model specifies which function belongs to each of its layers. The layers of the TCP/IP
    protocol suite contain relatively independent protocols that can be mixed and matched
    depending on the needs of the system
    <p>The term hierarchical means that each upper-level protocol is supported by one or
        more lower level protocols. The TCP/IP protocol suite made of five layers:</p>
        <ol type="i">
            <li>Physical layer</li>
            <li>Data link layer</li>
            <li>Network layer</li>
            <li>Transport layer</li>
            <li>Application layer</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Physical and Data link layer</h3>
        These layers support all the standard and proprietary protocols. A network in a
TCP/IP internetwork can be LAN or WAN

    <article>
        <h3>Network Layer</h3>
        At the network layer, TCP/IP supports the Internetworking Protocol (IP) and uses four
supporting protocols: ARP, RARP, ICMP and IGMP.
    </article>
    <article>
        <h3>Internetworking Protocol (IP)</h3>
        The IP is the transmission mechanism used by the TCP/IP protocols. It is unreliable
and connectionless protocols- a best effort delivery service.
<p>The IP transport data in packets called datagrams, each of which transported
    separately. Datagrams can travel along different routing and can arrive out of sequence or be
    duplicated. IP does not keep track of the routes and has no facilities for reordering datagrams
    once they arrive at their destination.</p>

        <h3>Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)</h3>
        ARP is used to associate a logical address with a physical address. ARP is used to
        find the physical address of the node when its internet address in known.
        <p>On a typical physical network such as LAN, each device on a link is identified by a
            physical or station address, usually imprinted on the Network Interface Card (NIC).</p>    
        <h3>Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP</h3>
        RARP allows a host to discover its Internet address when it knows only its physical
        address. It is used when a computer is connected to a network for the first time.    
    <h3>Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)</h3>
    ICMP is a mechanism used by host and gateways to send notification of datagram
problems back to the sender. ICMP sends query and error reporting message
<h3>Internet group Message Protocol (IGMP)</h3>
IGMP used to facilitate the simultaneous transmission of message to a group of
recipients.

    <article>
        <h3>Transport Layer</h3>
        The transport layer represented in TCP/IP by two protocols: TCP and UDP.
        <p>TCP and UDP responsible for delivery of message from a process to another process.</p>

        <h3>User Datagram Protocol (UDP)</h3>
        UDP is a process-to-process protocol that adds only port address, checksum error
control and length information to the data from the upper layer.
    </article>
    <article>
        <h3>Transmission Control protocol (TCP)</h3>
        TCP is a reliable connection oriented protocol. A connection must be established
between both ends of a transmission before either can transmit data.
<p>At the sending end of each transmission, TCP divides a stream of data into smaller
    units called segments. Each segment includes a sequence number for reordering after receipt,
    together with an acknowledgement number for the segment received.</p>
    <p>At the receiving end, TCP collects each datagrams as it comes in and reorders the
        transmission based on sequence numbers.</p>

        <h3>Application Layer</h3>
        The application Layer provides service to the use.
        <h4>ADDRESSING</h4>
        Four levels of addresses are used in an internet employing the TCP/IP protocols: physical
        (link) addresses, logical (IP) addresses, port addresses, and specific addresses.
    
    </article>
    
    <p>Each address is related to a specific layer in the TCPIIP architecture, as shown in below
        Figure.</p>
