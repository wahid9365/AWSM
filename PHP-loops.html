<h2>PHP Loops</h2>
Loops are used to execute the same block of code again and again, as long as a certain condition is true.
<p>In PHP, we have the following loop types:
<ul>
<li>while - loops through a block of code as long as the specified condition is true</li>
<li>do...while - loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop as long as the specified condition is true</li>
<li>for - loops through a block of code a specified number of times</li>
<li>foreach - loops through a block of code for each element in an array</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>The PHP while Loop</h3>
The while loop executes a block of code as long as the specified condition is true.
<pre>
Syntax:
	while (condition is true)
	{
		code to be executed;
	}
</pre>
Examples
<p>The example below displays the numbers from 1 to 5:</p>
<pre>
	< ?php
	$x = 1;
	while($x <= 5)
	{
	   echo "The number is: $x <br>";
	   $x++;
	}
	? >
</pre>
<h3>The PHP do...while Loop</h3>
The do...while loop will always execute the block of code once, it will then check the
condition, and repeat the loop while the specified condition is true.
<pre>
Syntax:
do
{
    code to be executed;
}
while (condition is true);
</pre>
</p>
Example:
<br>The example below first sets a variable $x to 1 ($x = 1). Then, the do while loop will write some output, and then increment the variable $x with 1. Then the condition is checked (is $x less than, or equal to 5?), and the loop will continue to run as long as $x is less than, or equal to 5:
<pre>
< ?php
$x = 1;
do {
   echo "The number is: $x <br>";
   $x++;
} while ($x <= 5);
? >
</pre>
<h3>The PHP for Loop</h3>
The for loop is used when you know in advance how many times the script should run.
<pre>
Syntax
for (init counter; test counter; increment counter)
{
   code to be executed for each iteration;
}
</pre>
Parameters:
<ul>
<li>init counter: Initialize the loop counter value</li>
<li>test counter: Evaluated for each loop iteration. If it evaluates to TRUE, the loop</li> continues. If it evaluates to FALSE, the loop ends.
<li>increment counter: Increases the loop counter value</li>
</ul>
Examples:
<br>The example below displays the numbers from 0 to 10:
<pre>
< ?php
for ($x = 0; $x <= 10; $x++) {
   echo "The number is: $x <br>";
}
? >
</pre>
<h3>The PHP foreach Loop</h3>
The foreach loop works only on arrays, and is used to loop through each key/value pair in an array.
<pre>
Syntax:
foreach ($array as $value) {
   code to be executed;
}
</pre>
For every loop iteration, the value of the current array element is assigned to $value and the array pointer is moved by one, until it reaches the last array element.
<p>Examples
<br>The following example will output the values of the given array ($colors):</p>
<pre>
< ?php
$colors = array("red", "green", "blue", "yellow");
foreach ($colors as $value) {
   echo "$value <br>";
}
? >
</pre>
