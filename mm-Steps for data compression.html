    <h3>Steps for data compression</h3>
    <p>Figure below shows the typical sequence of operations performed in the compression of
        still images and video and audio data streams.</p>

            <li><b>Preparation step:</b>Preparation includes analog-to-digital conversion and generating an
                appropriate digital representation of the information. An image is divided into blocks of
                8X8 pixels, and represented by a fixed number of bits per pixel.</li>
            <li><b>Processing step:</b>Processing is actually the first step of the compression process which
                makes use of sophisticated algorithms. A transformation from the time to the frequency
                domain can be performed using DCT. In the case of motion video compression,
                interframe coding uses a motion vector for each 8x8 block.</li>
            <li><b>Quantization step:</b>Quantization processes the results of the previous step. It specifies
                the granularity of the mapping of real numbers into integers. This process results in a reduction of precision. In the transformed domain, the coefficients are distinguished
                according to their significance. For example, they could be quantized using a different
                number of bits per coefficient.</li>
            <li><b>Entropy Encoding:</b>Entropy encoding is usually the last step. It compresses a sequential
                digital data stream without loss. For example, a sequence of zeroes in a data stream can
                be compressed by specifying the number of occurrences followed by the zero itself.</li>
