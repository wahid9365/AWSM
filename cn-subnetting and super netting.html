    <h3>Subnetting</h3>
    During the era of classful addressing, subnetting was introduced. If an organization was
    granted a large block in class A or B, it could divide the addresses into several contiguous groups
    and assign each group to smaller networks (called subnets) or, in rare cases, share part of the
    addresses with neighbors.
<h3>Supernetting</h3>
The time came when most of the class A and class B addresses were depleted; however, there
was still a huge demand for midsize blocks. The size of a class C block with a maximum number
of 256 addresses did not satisfy the needs of most organizations. Even a midsize organization
needed more addresses. One solution was supernetting. In supernetting, an organization can
combine several class C blocks to create a larger range of addresses. In other words, several
networks are combined to create a supernetwork or a supemet. An organization can apply for a
set of class C blocks instead of just one. For example, an organization that needs 1000 addresses
can be granted four contiguous class C blocks. The organization can then use these addresses to
create one supernetwork.
