<br><br><b>Alibaba Group Holding Limited</b>, or <b>Alibaba</b> is a
Chinese multinational technology company specializing in e-
commerce, retail, Internet, and technology. Founded on 28 June
1999[1] in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, the company provides consumer-to-
consumer (C2C), business-to-consumer (B2C), and business-to-business (B2B)
sales services via Chinese and global marketplaces, as well as local consumer,
digital media and entertainment, logistics and cloud computing services. It owns
and operates a diverse portfolio of companies around the world in numerous
business sectors.

has the ninth-highest global brand valuation.</p>
<h1><u>For Overview:</u></h1>
Initially, before Amazon entered the Indian market, the industry had several
players Flipkart, Myntra, Snapdeal, Let’s Buy, India Times Shopping,
<b><p>Present scenario in Amazon vs Flipkart vs Snapdeal</p>
Market share of these sharks has increased considerably. The three major
Players are Flipkart, Amazon and Snapdeal. We canâ€™t envisage any
new player emerging from the mirage.</b>
<p>The sharks have now become bigger for the ocean as Flipkart acquired Myntra.
Money is being poured in at an alarming rate. As Flipkart announced a $1
billion financing, Amazon decided to steal Filpkart’s thunder by announcing
that it would invest $2 billion in its Indian entity. Tapping the maximum
possible market is the key & obviously demographics are a factor.</p>
The final Scenario Only 2 major players left. Flipkart and Amazon have to
survive this. Snapdeal has an outside shot. Flipkart will go for an IPO in either
US or Singapore (* Flipkart files to become a public company). E-commerce
will eventually drive towards profitability though, the smaller sharks will be
eaten up by the bigger ones, either via acquisitions – or we’d see plenty of mid-
size sharks forming alliances.
<br>The online commerce market in India has a very low penetration. We haven’t
even begun to scorch the surface here in terms of potential. India does
something around $3 billion a year in Commerce; whilst China does something
around $100+ billion major due to the Jack Ma led Alibaba which recently got
listed on NYSE (*Alibaba valuation analysis).
<p>As of today, the biggest player in this market is Flipkart, followed by the rest.
Amazon has covered a good percentage of market in a short time, but the race
has just started & Flipkartâ€™s already some paces ahead, for now. Flipkart’s
investors knew that the real e-commerce battle in India was not Flipkart versus
Infibeam or Snapdeal. They knew even before the launch of Amazon.in that the
real contender was Amazon.
<br>Amazon Indiaâ€™s sales are estimated at over $200 million (Rs 1,200 crore). It
took flipkart 7 years to achieve the sales numbers, snapdeal expects to reach it
this year while amazon might clock Rs 6,000 crore by the end of March 2016.</p>
