    <h3>MS Access</h3>
    Databases created in the Access 2007 format have the file extension .accdb, and databases
created in earlier Access formats have the file extension .mdb.
    <p>Using Access, you can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Add new data to a database, such as a new item in an inventory</li>
        <li>Edit existing data in the database, such as changing the current location of an item</li>
        <li>Delete information, perhaps if an item is sold or discarded</li>
        <li>Organize and view the data in different ways</li>
        <li>Share the data with others via reports, e-mail messages, an intranet , or the Internet</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The parts of an Access database</h3>
    The following sections are short descriptions of the parts of a typical Access database.
    <ul>
        <li>Tables</li>
        <li>Forms</li>
        <li>Reports</li>
        <li>Queries</li>
        <li>Macros</li>
        <li>Modules</li>
    </ul>

        <h4>Tables</h4>
        A database table is similar in appearance to a spreadsheet, in that data is stored in rows and
columns. Each row in a table is referred to as a record. Records are where the individual pieces of
information are stored. Each record consists of one or more fields. Fields correspond to the columns
in the table. For example, you might have a table named "Employees" where each record (row)
contains information about a different employee, and each field (column) contains a different type of
information, such as first name, last name, address, and so on. Fields must be designated as a certain
data type, whether it's text, date or time, number, or some other type.

        <h4>Forms</h4>
        Forms are sometimes referred to as "data entry screens." They are the interfaces we use to
work with our data, and they often contain command buttons that perform various commands. We
can create a database without using forms by simply editing our data in the table datasheets.
However, most database users prefer to use forms for viewing, entering, and editing data in the tables.

        <h4>Reports</h4>
        Reports are what we use to summarize and present data in the tables. A report usually answers
a specific question, such as "How much money did we receive from each customer this year?" or
"What cities are our customers located in?" Each report can be formatted to present the information in
the most readable way possible.

        <h4>Queries</h4>
        Queries are the real workhorses in a database, and can perform many different functions.
Their most common function is to retrieve specific data from the tables. The data we want to see is
usually spread across several tables, and queries allow us to view it in a single datasheet. Also, since
we usually don't want to see all the records at once, queries let us add criteria to "filter" the data down
to just the records we want.

        <h4>>Macros</h4>
        Macros in Access can be thought of as a simplified programming language which we can use to add
functionality to our database. For example, we can attach a macro to a command button on a form so
that the macro runs whenever the button is clicked. Macros contain actions that perform tasks, such as
opening a report, running a query, or closing the database. Most database operations that we do
manually can be automated by using macros,  so they can be great time-saving devices.

        <h4>Modules</h4>
        Modules, like macros, are objects we can use to add functionality to our database. Whereas we create
macros in Access by choosing from a list of macro actions, we write modules in the Visual Basic for
Applications (VBA) programming language. A module is a collection of declarations, statements, and
procedures that are stored together as a unit. A module can be either a class module or a standard
module. Class modules are attached to forms or reports, and usually contain procedures that are
specific to the form or report they're attached to. Standard modules contain general procedures that
aren't associated with any other object.
