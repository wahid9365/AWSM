<h2>WWW based security schemes</h2>
Several methods can provide security in the web framework irrespective of e-
commerce. These include the following:
<ul>
<li><b>Secure HTTP (S-HTTP):</b> Secure HTTP is an extension to the HTTP that allows the
secure exchange of files on the World Wide Wave. Each S-HTTP file is either encrypted,
that contains a digital certificate or both. For a given document, S-HTTP is an alternative
to the other well known security protocol, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).</li>
<li><b>Secure Sockets Layer (SSL):</b> SSL is a protocol that uses RSA security to wrap security
information around TCP/IP based protocol. This implementation while different from S-
HTTP, accomplishes the same task.</li>
<li><b>SHEN:</b> SHEN is a security scheme for the web sponsored by the W3 consortium. It is
similar to S-HTTP but it is a non-commercial or more research oriented security.</li>
</ul>
