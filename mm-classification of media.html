<body>
    <p>Media can be classified with respect to different criteria. Classification of media
        according to perception, representation, presentation, storage, transmission and
        information exchange.</p>
        <h3>The perception medium</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The perception media help humans to sense their environment. The perception of
                information occurs mostly through seeing or hearing the information.</li>
            <li>For the perception of information through seeing, the visual media sush as text,
                image and video are used.</li>
            <li>For perception of information through hearing, auditory media such as music,
                noise and speech are relevant.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The Representation Medium</h3>
        <p>Representation media are characterized by internal computer representation of
            information. The various formats are used to represent media information in a computer.
            For example,</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A text character is coded in ASCII or EBCDIC code.</li>
                <li>Graphic are coded according to CEPT or CAPTAIN videotext standard</li>
                <li>An image can be coded in JPEG format</li>
                <li>A combined audio/video sequence can be coded in different TV standard formats
                    (eg. PAL) and stored in the computer using an MPEG format.</li>
            </ul>
   <h3>The presentation medium</h3>
   <p>The presentation medium refers to the tools and devices for the input and output of
    information. The media such as paper, screen and speaker are used to deliver the
    information by the computer (output media); keyboard, mouse, camera and microphone
    are the input media.</p>
    <h3>The storage media</h3>
    <p>Storage media refer to a data carrier which enables storage of information. Hard
        disk, CD/DVD are examples of storage media.</p>
        <h3>The transmission media</h3>
        <p>The transmission media refers to different information carier, that enables
            continuous data transmission. The information is transmitted over networks, which are
            wire and cable transmission such as coaxial cable as well as wireless transmission.</p>
            <h3>The information exchange medium</h3>
            <p>The information exchange medium includes all information carriers for
                transmission i.e. all storage and transmission media.</p>
                <h3>Representation Space and Representation values</h3>
                <p><ul><li>Representation space can be considered as a part of the presentation media for
                    information output. Examples of visual representation spaces are paper or screen.
                    During a computer-controlled slide show with simultaneous projection of the
                    computer screen content, the whole screen count as a representation spaces.</li>
                    <li>Representation values determine the information representation of different of
                    media. For example, text medium visually represents a sequence through a
                    sequence of characters.</li></ul></p>
