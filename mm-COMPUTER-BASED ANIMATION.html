    <h3>COMPUTER-BASED ANIMATION</h3>
    <p>To animate something is, literally, to bring it to life. An animation covers all changes that
        have a visual effect. Visual effects can be of different nature. They might include time-varying
        positions (motion dynamics), shape, color, transparency, structure and texture of an object
        (update dynamics), and changes in lighting, camera position, orientation and focus.</p>
    <p>A computer-based animation is an animation performed by a computer using graphical
        tools to provide visual effects. The different stages of computer-based animation are as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Input Process:</b>
                Before computer can be used, drawings must be digitized. This can be done through
                optical scanning, tracing the drawings with a data tablet or producing the original
                drawings with a drawing program</li>
            <li><b>Composition Stage:</b>
                In composition stage, foreground and background figures are combined to generate the
                individual frames for the final animation. This can be performed with image-composition
                technique.</li>
            <li><b>In between Process:</b>
                The animation of movement from one position to another needs a composition of frames
                with intermediate position (intermediate frames) in between the key frames. This is called the in
                between process. The process of in between is performed in computer-based animation through
                interpolation. The system gets only the starting and ending positions.</li>
            <li><b>Changing Colors:</b>
                For changing colors, computer-based animation uses CLUT (lut) in a frame buffer and
                the process of double buffering. The lut animation is generated by manipulating the lut. The
                simplest method is to cycle the colors in the lut, thus changing the colors of the various pieces of
                the image. Using lut animation is faster than sending an entire new pixmap to the frame buffer
                for each frame.</li>
        </ol>
