    PowerPoint is a Microsoft presentation program that creates a slide show of important
information, charts, and images to display during a presentation. PowerPoint is a tool we can
use to communicate our ideas effectively through visual aids that look professionally
designed yet are easy to make. With PowerPoint, we can create slides for our presentation in
the output we require: blank and white overheads, color overheads, 35mm slides or on-screen
electronic slide shows. In addition, we can prepare speakerâ€Ÿs notes, print an outline and print
audience handouts. All these components in one file make up a PowerPoint Presentation.
