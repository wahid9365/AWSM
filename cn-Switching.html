    <h3>Switching</h3>
   <p>A switched network consists of a series of interlinked nodes, called switches. Switches are
    devices capable of creating temporary connections between two or more devices linked to the
    switch. In a switched network, some of these nodes are connected to the end systems
    (computers or telephones, for example). Others are used only for routing. Below Figure
    shows a switched network.</p>

    <p>The end systems (communicating devices) are labeled A, B, C, D, and so on, and the
switches are labeled I, II, III, IV, and V. Each switch is connected to multiple links.</p>

<p>Packet-switched networks can further be divided into two subcategories-virtual-circuit
    networks and datagram networks as shown below</p>

    <h3>CIRTCUIT-SWITCHED NETWORK</h3>
    A circuit-switched network consists of a set of switches connected by physical links. A
connection between two stations is a dedicated path made of one or more links. However,
each connection uses only one dedicated channel on each link. Each link is normally divided
into n channels by using FDM or TDM.
<p>Below Figure shows a trivial circuit-switched network with four switches and four
    links. Each link is divided into n (n is 3 in the figure) channels by using FDM or TDM.</p>
<img src="Circuit-switched Network.png" alt="Circuit-switched Network" height="300";>
<p>The end systems, such as computers or telephones, are directly connected to a switch.
    When end system A needs to communicate with end system M, system A needs to request a
    connection to M that must be accepted by all switches as well as by M itself. This is called
    the setup phase; a circuit (channel) is reserved on each link, and the combination of circuits
    or channels defines the dedicated path. After the dedicated path made of connected circuits
    (channels) is established, data transfer can take place. After all data have been transferred, the
    circuits are tom down.</p>
    <h4>Three Phases of Circuit-Switched Network</h4>
<p>The actual communication in a circuit-switched network requires three phases:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <h3>Connection setup:</h3>
        Before the two parties (or multiple parties in a conference call) can communicate, a
dedicated circuit (combination of channels in links) needs to be established. The end systems
are normally connected through dedicated lines to the switches, so connection setup means
creating dedicated channels between the switches.
<p>The end-to-end addressing is required for creating a connection between the two end
    systems. These can be, for example, the addresses of the computers assigned by the
    administrator in a TDM network, or telephone numbers in an FDM network.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Data Transfer Phase:</h3>
        After the establishment of the dedicated circuit (channels), the two parties can transfer data.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Teardown Phase</h3>
        When one of the parties needs to disconnect, a signal is sent to each switch to release the
resources.
    </li>
</ol>

    <h3>PACKETS SWITCH NETWORK</h3>
    In data communications, we need to send messages from one end system to another. If
the message is going to pass through a packet-switched network, it needs to be divided into
packets of fixed or variable size. The size of the packet is determined by the network and the
governing protocol
<p>In packet switching, there is no resource allocation for a packet. This means that there
    is no reserved bandwidth on the links, and there is no scheduled processing time for each
    packet. Resources are allocated on demand. The allocation is done on a first-come, first-
    served basis. When a switch receives a packet, no matter what is the source or destination, the
    packet must wait if there are other packets being processed.</p>

</article>
<article>
    <h3>Datagram Network</h3>
    In a datagram network, each packet is treated independently of all others. Even if a
packet is part of a multi-packet transmission, the network treats it as though it existed alone.
Packets in this approach are referred to as datagrams. Datagram switching is normally done at
the network layer.
<p>Below Figure shows how the datagram approach is used to deliver four packets from
    station A to station X. The switches in a datagram network are traditionally referred to as
    routers. In this example, all four packets (or datagrams) belong to the same message, but may
    travel different paths to reach their destination. This is so because the links may be involved
    in carrying packets from other sources and do not have the necessary bandwidth available to
    carry all the packets from A to X.</p>

<article>
    <h3>Routing Table</h3>
    In datagram network, each switch (or packet switch) has a routing table which is
based on the destination address. The routing tables are dynamic and are updated
periodically. The destination addresses and the corresponding forwarding output ports are
recorded in the tables. Below Figure shows the routing table for a switch.
</article>

<h3>Destination address in Datagram network</h3>
Every packet in a datagram network carries a header that contains, among other
information, the destination address of the packet. When the switch receives the packet, this
destination address is examined; the routing table is consulted to find the corresponding port
through which the packet should be forwarded. This address remains the same during the
entire journey of the packet.
<h4>VIRTUAL-CIRCUIT NETWORK</h4>
A virtual-circuit network is a cross between a circuit-switched network and a
datagram network. It has some characteristics of both.
<ol>
    <li>As in a circuit-switched network, there are setup and teardown phases in addition
        to the data transfer phase.</li>
    <li>Resources can be allocated during the setup phase, as in a circuit-switched
        network, or on demand, as in a datagram network</li>
    <li>As in a datagram network, data are packetized and each packet carries an address
        in the header.</li>
    <li>As in a circuit-switched network, all packets follow the same path established
        during the connection.</li>
    <li>A virtual-circuit network is normally implemented in the data link layer, while a
        circuit-switched network is implemented in the physical layer and a datagram
        network in the network layer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Below Figure is an example of a virtual-circuit network. The network has switches that
    allow traffic from sources to destinations. A source or destination can be a computer, packet
    switch, bridge, or any other device that connects other networks</p>

    <h3>Addressing in Virtual-circuit network</h3>
    In a virtual-circuit network, two types of addressing are involved: global and loca
(virtual-circuit identifier).
</article>
<article>
    <h3>Global Addressing</h3>
    A source or a destination needs to have a global address-an address that can be unique
in the scope of the network or internationally if the network is part of an international
network.
</article>
<article>
    <h3> Virtual-Circuit Identifier</h3>
    The identifier that is actually used for data transfer is called the virtual-circuit
identifier (VCI). A VCI, unlike a global address, is a small number that has only switch
scope; it is used by a frame between two switches. When a frame arrives at a switch, it has a
VCI; when it leaves, it has a different VCI. Below figure shows how the VCI in a data frame
changes from one switch to another.
