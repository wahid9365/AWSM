options, you just need to remember a certain pin, and that’s it, your transaction

businesses can operate globally and have a customer base irrespective of
geographical limitations. So implementing online payment options on the e-
commerce site will undoubtedly increase sales as you it be catering for a global
audience.</li>
<li><b>Low transaction costs</b><br>
In a traditional payment setup, businesses have to hire front-desk employees or
cashiers to manage sales and payments. But with online payments, transactions
take place in an automated environment. Merchants can set up online payment
gateways with minimal investment and lower transaction costs.</li>

available in order to choose the best one.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Disadvantage of Online Payments:</h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Technical problems</b><br>
Online payments are subject to technical failures or downtime, just like any
other software that is dependent on technology. Though tech maintenance
operations are announced in advance and usually take place during the night,
sometimes, it can cause frustration among online shoppers. Especially when it
takes place without prior warning, a lot of businesses experience heavy bounce
rates.</li>
<li><b>Password threats</b><br>
If you are a registered user with a website who uses online payments pretty
often, there are high chances that the online portal can have access to your
personal information or bank account details. Though most transactions use
OTPs (one-time passwords), the need for password protection arises in such
situations. Especially if you are someone who deals with different banks, you
might face the risk of a privacy breach.</li>
<li><b>Cost of fraud</b><br>
Just as more and more people are shifting to online payments and preferring
them over other traditional forms of payment, so are cybercriminals. ID thefts,
phishing attacks, and database exploits are becoming more common. In order to
prevent these and increase security, businesses install a lot of payment-security
softwares and eventually incur a lot of costs.</li>
<li><b>Security Concerns</b><br>
As discussed in the previous point, using online payments come with a lot of
security risks. Without proper security measures, fraudsters can easily hack
important financial information and data. And since there aren’t any verification
systems like facial recognition or biometrics, criminals can easily get away
without getting caught.</li>
<li><b>Technological illiteracy</b><br>
One of the main disadvantages of online payments is the technological illiteracy
among many people, especially the older generation. Since they don’t have
enough knowledge on how to go about using technology or smartphones, they
refrain from using online payment methods. A lot of them also fear the
complexities of it and continue to use traditional methods of payment. This is a
huge drawback in developing countries like India.</li>
<li><b>Limitations on amount and time</b><br>
Some banks limit the number of transactions you can do in a day or the
maximum amount you can transfer in a day. Most online transactions also have
a time limit under which you need to complete the process (like receiving and
accepting OTPs). All these limitations can prove to be pretty inconvenient to
some users.</li>
