    <h2>IMAGES AND GRAPHICS</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>An image is a spatial representation of an object, a two-dimensional or three- dimensional
            scene or another image. It can be real or virtual.</li>
        <li>An image may be abstractly thought of as a continuous function defining usually a
            rectangular region of a plane. For example, for optic or photographic sensors, an image is
            typically proportional to the radiant energy received in the electromagnetic band to which
            the sensor or detector is sensitive. In this case, the image is called an intensity image.</li>
        <li>For range finder sensors, an image is a function of the line-of-sight distance from the
            sensor position to an object in the three-dimensional world; such an image is called a
            range image.</li>
        <li>A recorded image may be in a photographic, analog video signal or digital format. In
            computer vision, an image is usually a recorded image such as a video image, digital
            image or a picture. In computer graphics, an image is always a digital image. In
            multimedia applications, all formats can be presented.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Digital Image Representation</h3>
    <p>A digital image is represented by a matrix of numeric values each representing a
        quantized intensity value. When I is a two-dimensional matrix, then I(r,c) is the intensity value at
        the position corresponding to row r and column c of the matrix. The points at which an image is
        sampled are known as picture elements, commonly abbreviated as pixels. The pixel values of
        intensity images are called gray scale levels.</p>
        <p>The intensity at each pixel is represented by an integer and is determined from the
            continuous image by averaging over a small neighborhood around the pixel location.</p>
            <p>If there are just two intensity values, for example, black and white, they are represented
                by the numbers 0 and 1; such images are called binary-valued images. When 8-bit integers are
                used to store each pixel value, the gray levels range from 0 (black) to 255 (white).</p>
