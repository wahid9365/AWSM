<h2>What is Online Learning?</h2>
Online education generally refers to education that takes place through the
Internet. There is no conventional description, although numerous websites and
writers have described it in various ways. For example, according to a web page
on India Education, "online education is electronically aided learning that relies
on the Internet for teacher/student contact and the dissemination of class
materials. Online learning is a kind of distance education, such as web-based, e-
learning, and digital learning. It is accessible over the Internet and uses web-
based content and activities. The Advanced Research Project Agency of the
United States Department of Defense pioneered e-learning in 1969 using Internet
technology.
<h3>What Are The Advantages Of Online Learning?</h3>
<ol>
<li><u><b>Efficiency</b></u><br>
Online learning offers teachers an efficient way to deliver lessons to students.
Online learning has a number of tools such as videos, PDFs, podcasts, and
teachers can use all these tools as part of their lesson plans. By extending the
lesson plan beyond traditional textbooks to include online resources, teachers
are able to become more efficient educators.</li>
<li><u><b>Accessibility Of Time And Place</b></u><br>
Another advantage of online education is that it allows students to attend classes
from any location of their choice. It also allows schools to reach out to a more
extensive network of students, instead of being restricted by geographical
boundaries. Additionally, online lectures can be recorded, archived, and shared
for future reference. This allows students to access the learning material at a
time of their comfort.
<br>Thus, online learning offers students the accessibility of time and place in
education.</li>
<li><u><b>Affordability</b></u><br>
Another advantage of online learning is reduced financial costs. Online
education is far more affordable as compared to physical learning. This is
because online learning eliminates the cost points of student transportation,
student meals, and most importantly, real estate. Additionally, all the course or
study materials are available online, thus creating a paperless learning
environment which is more affordable, while also being beneficial to the
environment.</li>
<li><u><b>Improved Student Attendance</b></u><br>
Since online classes can be taken from home or location of choice, there are
fewer chances of students missing out on lessons.</li>
<li><u><b>Suits A Variety Of Learning Styles</b></u><br>
Every student has a different learning journey and a different learning style.
Some students are visual learners, while some students prefer to learn through
audio. Similarly, some students thrive in the classroom, and other students are
solo learners who get distracted by large groups.
<br>The online learning system, with its range of options and resources, can be
personalized in many ways. It is the best way to create a perfect learning
environment suited to the needs of each student.</li>
</ol>
<h3>What Are The Disadvantages Of Online Learning?</h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Inability to Focus On Screens</b><br>
For many students, one of the biggest challenges of online learning is the
struggle with focusing on the screen for long periods of time. With online
learning, there is also a greater chance for students to be easily distracted by
social media or other sites. Therefore, it is imperative for the teachers to keep
their online classes crisp, engaging, and interactive to help students stay focused
on the lesson.</li>
<li><b>Technology Issues</b><br>
Another key challenge of online classes is internet connectivity. While internet
penetration has grown in leaps and bounds over the past few years, in smaller
cities and towns, a consistent connection with decent speed is a problem.
Without a consistent internet connection for students or teachers, there can be a
lack of continuity in learning for the child. This is detrimental to the education
process.</li>
<li><b>Sense Of Isolation</b><br>
Students can learn a lot from being in the company of their peers. However, in
an online class, there are minimal physical interactions between students and
teachers. This often results in a sense of isolation for the students. In this
situation, it is imperative that the school allow for other forms of
communication between the students, peers, and teachers. This can include
online messages, emails and video conferencing that will allow for face-to-face
interaction and reduce the sense of isolation.</li>
<li><b>Teacher Training</b><br>
Online learning requires teachers to have a basic understanding of using digital
forms of learning. However, this is not the case always. Very often, teachers
have a very basic understanding of technology. Sometimes, they don’t even
have the necessary resources and tools to conducts online classes.
<br>To combat this, it is important for schools to invest in training teachers with the
latest technology updates so that they can conduct their online classes
seamlessly.</li>
<li><b>Manage Screen Time</b><br>
Many parents are concerned about the health hazards of having their children
spend so many hours staring at a screen. This increase in screen time is one of
the biggest concerns and disadvantages of online learning. Sometimes students
also develop bad posture and other physical problems due to staying hunched in
front of a screen.</li>
