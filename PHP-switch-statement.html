<h2>The PHP Switch Statement</h2>
Use the switch statement to select one of many blocks of code to be executed.
<p>Syntax</p>
<pre>
switch (n) {
    case label1:
	code to be executed if n=label1;
	break;
    case label2:
	code to be executed if n=label2;
	break;
    case label3:
	code to be executed if n=label3;
	break;
	...
    default:
	code to be executed if n is different from all labels;
}
</pre>
This is how it works: First we have a single expression n (most often a variable), that is evaluated once. The value of the expression is then compared with the values for each case in the structure. If there is a match, the block of code associated with that case is executed.
<br>Use 'break' to prevent the code from running into the next case automatically.
<br>The 'default' statement is used if no match is found.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
< ?php
$favcolor = "red";
switch ($favcolor) {
    case "red":
	echo "Your favorite color is red!";
	break;
    case "blue":
	echo "Your favorite color is blue!";
	break;
    case "green":
	echo "Your favorite color is green!";
	break;
    default:
	echo "Your favorite color is neither red, blue, nor green!";
}
