<h2>Units of Measurements</h2>
<ul><li><b>Storage measurements:</b> The basic unit used in computer data storage is called a bit
(binary digit). Computers use these little bits, which are composed of ones
and zeros, to do things and talk to other computers. All your files, for
instance, are kept in the computer as binary files and translated into words
and pictures by the software (which is also ones and zeros). This two
number system, is called a “binary number system” since it has only two
numbers in it. The decimal number system in contrast has ten unique digits,
zero through nine.
