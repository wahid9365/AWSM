    <H3>IMAGE TRANSMISSION</H3>
    <p>Image transmission takes into account transmission of digital images through computer
        networks. There are several requirements on the networks when images are transmitted:</p>
        <ol>
            <Li>The network must accommodate bursty data transport because image transmission is
                bursty (The burst is caused by the large size of the image).</Li>
            <Li>Image transmission requires reliable transport;</Li>
            <Li>Time-dependence is not a dominant characteristic of the image in contrast to audio
                video transmission.</Li>
           <p>Image size depends on the image representation format used for transmission. There are several
            possibilities:</p></ol>
          <ul> 
            <li><p><b>Raw image data transmission:</b>In this case, the image is generated through a video
                digitizer and transmitted in its digital format. The size can be computed in the following
                manner:</p>
                <dfn=>𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒 = 𝑠𝑝𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙_𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 × 𝑝𝑖𝑥𝑒𝑙_𝑞𝑢𝑎𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑧𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛</dfn>
                <p>For example, the transmission of an image with a resolution of 640x 480 pixel and pixel
                    quantization of 8 bits per pixel requires transmission of 307,200 bytes through the network.</p>
<li><b>Compressed image data transmission:</b> In this case, the image is generated through a
    video digitizer and compressed before transmission. Methods such as JPEG or MPEG are
    used to downsize the image. The reduction of image size depends on the compression
    method and compression rate.</li>
    <li><b>Symbolic image data transmission:</b> In this case, the image is represented through
        symbolic data representation as image primitives (e.g. 2D or 3D geometric
        representation), attributes and other control information.</li>

        </ul>
