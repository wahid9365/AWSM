<h2><u>Protecting Internet communications (Encryption)</u></h2>
<h3>Cryptography, Encryption and Decryption</h3>
Cryptography is a collection of mathematical techniques for protecting information.
Using cryptography, we can transform written words and other kinds of message so that they are
unintelligible to anyone who does not possess a specific mathematical key necessary to unlock
the message.
<p>The process of using cryptography to scramble a message is called encryption. The
process of unscrambling the message by use of the appropriate key is called decryption.</p>
The original message prior to encryption is known as plain text while the encrypted
message is known as cipher text.

The encryption means the process of transforming plain text or data into cipher text that
cannot be read by anyone other than the sender and receiver. The purpose of encryption is to
secure stored information and information transmission. It provides:
<ul>
<li>Message integrity</li>
<li>Non-repudiation</li>
<li>Authentication</li>
<li>Confidentiality</li>
</ul>
<h2>Securing channels of communication</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Secure Sockets Layer (SSL):</b> It is the most common form of securing channels of
communication; used to establish a secure negotiated session (client-server session in
which URL of requested document, along with contents, is encrypted).
<br>SSL is a protocol that uses RSA security to wrap security information around
TCP/IP based protocol. This implementation while different from S-HTTP, accomplishes
the same task</li>
<li><b>S-HTTP:</b> Secure HTTP is an extension to the HTTP that allows the secure exchange of
files on the World Wide Wave. Each S-HTTP file is either encrypted, that contains a
digital certificate or both. For a given document, S-HTTP is an alternative to the other
well known security protocol, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). It provides a secure message-
oriented communications protocol designed for use in conjunction with HTTP</li>
<li><b>Virtual Private Networks (VPNs):</b> VPNs Allow remote users to securely access internal
networks via the Internet, using Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Protecting Networks</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Firewall:</b> Hardware or software filters communications packets and prevents some
packets from entering the network based on a security policy</li>
<p>Firewall methods include:
<ul><li>Packet filters</li>
<li>Application gateways</li></ul>
<li><b>Proxy servers:</b> Software servers that handle all communications originating from or being
sent to the Internet</li>
</ul>
<h2>Protecting servers and clients</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Operating system controls:</b> Authentication and access control mechanisms</li>
<li><b>Anti-virus software:</b> Easiest and least expensive way to prevent threats to system integrity</li>
</ul>
