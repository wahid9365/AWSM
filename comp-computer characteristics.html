<h2>Characteristics of Computer</h2>
Speed, accuracy, diligence, storage capability and versatility are some of the key
characteristics of a computer. A brief overview of these characteristics are
<ul>
<li><b>Speed:</b><br> The computer can process data very fast, at the rate of millions of instructions
per second. Some calculations that would have taken hours and days to
complete otherwise, can be completed in a few seconds using the computer.
For example, calculation and generation of salary slips of thousands of
employees of an organization, weather forecasting that requires analysis of a
large amount of data related to temperature, pressure and humidity of various
places, etc.</li>
<li><b>Accuracy:</b><br> Computer provides a high degree of accuracy. For example, the computer
can accurately give the result of division of any two numbers up to 10 decimal
places.</li>
<li><b>Diligence:</b><br> When used for a longer period of time, the computer does not get tired or
fatigued. It can perform long and complex calculations with the same speed and
accuracy from the start till the end.</li>
<li><b>Storage Capability:</b><br> Large volumes of data and information can be stored in the
computer and also retrieved whenever required. A limited amount of data can
be stored, temporarily, in the primary memory. Secondary storage devices like
floppy disk and compact disk can store a large amount of data permanently.</li>
<li><b>Versatility:</b><br> Computer is versatile in nature. It can perform different types of tasks
with the same ease. At one moment you can use the computer to prepare a letter
document and in the next moment you may play music or print a document.
Computers have several limitations too. Computer can only perform tasks that
it has been programmed to do.Computer cannot do any work without instructions from the user. It executes
instructions as specified by the user and does not take its own decisions.</li>
